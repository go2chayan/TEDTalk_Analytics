VWell, the subject of difficult negotiation
p5
aVreminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East,
p6
aVof a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels.
p7
aVTo the first son, he left half the camels;
p8
aVto the second son, he left a third of the camels;
p9
aVand to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels.
p10
aVThe three sons got into a negotiation \u2014 17 doesn't divide by two.
p11
aVIt doesn't divide by three.
p12
aVIt doesn't divide by nine.
p13
aVBrotherly tempers started to get strained.
p14
aVFinally, in desperation,
p15
aVthey went and they consulted a wise old woman.
p16
aVThe wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time,
p17
aVand finally she came back and said, "Well, I don't know if I can help you,
p18
aVbut at least, if you want, you can have my camel."
p19
aVSo then, they had 18 camels.
p20
aVThe first son took his half \u2014 half of 18 is nine.
p21
aVThe second son took his third \u2014 a third of 18 is six.
p22
aVThe youngest son took his ninth \u2014 a ninth of 18 is two.
p23
aVYou get 17.
p24
aVThey had one camel left over.
p25
aVThey gave it back to the wise old woman.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, if you think about that story for a moment,
p30
aVI think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations
p31
aVwe get involved in.
p32
aVThey start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it.
p33
aVSomehow, what we need to do
p34
aVis step back from those situations, like that wise old woman,
p35
aVlook at the situation through fresh eyes
p36
aVand come up with an 18th camel.
p37
aVFinding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts
p38
aVhas been my life passion.
p39
aa(lp40
VI basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers.
p41
aVWe're all one family.
p42
aVWe know that scientifically,
p43
aVthanks to the communications revolution,
p44
aVall the tribes on the planet \u2014 all 15,000 tribes \u2014
p45
aVare in touch with each other.
p46
aVAnd it's a big family reunion.
p47
aVAnd yet, like many family reunions,
p48
aVit's not all peace and light.
p49
aVThere's a lot of conflict,
p50
aVand the question is: How do we deal with our differences?
p51
aVHow do we deal with our deepest differences,
p52
aVgiven the human propensity for conflict
p53
aVand the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction?
p54
aVThat's the question.
p55
aa(lp56
VAs I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four,
p57
aVtraveling the world,
p58
aVtrying to work, getting involved in conflicts
p59
aVranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East
p60
aVto Chechnya to Venezuela \u2014
p61
aVsome of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet \u2014
p62
aVI've been asking myself that question.
p63
aVAnd I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace.
p64
aVIt's actually surprisingly simple.
p65
aVIt's not easy, but it's simple.
p66
aVIt's not even new.
p67
aVIt may be one of our most ancient human heritages.
p68
aVThe secret to peace is us.
p69
aVIt's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict,
p70
aVwho can play a constructive role.
p71
aa(lp72
VLet me give you just a story, an example.
p73
aVAbout 20 years ago,
p74
aVI was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict,
p75
aVand I had an extra month,
p76
aVso I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen.
p77
aVI was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict.
p78
aVBecause, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers,
p79
aVliving pretty much like our ancestors lived
p80
aVfor maybe 99 percent of the human story.
p81
aVAnd all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting \u2014
p82
aVabsolutely fatal.
p83
aVSo how do they deal with their differences?
p84
aVWell, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities,
p85
aVsomeone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush,
p86
aVand then everyone sits around in a circle like this,
p87
aVand they sit and they talk and they talk.
p88
aVIt may take two days, three days, four days,
p89
aVbut they don't rest until they find a resolution
p90
aVor better yet \u2014 a reconciliation.
p91
aVAnd if tempers are still too high,
p92
aVthen they send someone off to visit some relatives,
p93
aVas a cooling-off period.
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, that system is, I think, probably the system
p96
aVthat kept us alive to this point,
p97
aVgiven our human tendencies.
p98
aVThat system, I call "the third side."
p99
aVBecause if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict,
p100
aVwhen we describe it,
p101
aVthere's always two sides \u2014
p102
aVit's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management,
p103
aVhusband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats.
p104
aVBut what we don't often see
p105
aVis that there's always a third side,
p106
aVand the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community,
p107
aVit's the friends, the allies,
p108
aVthe family members, the neighbors.
p109
aVAnd we can play an incredibly constructive role.
p110
aa(lp111
VPerhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help
p112
aVis to remind the parties of what's really at stake.
p113
aVFor the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family,
p114
aVfor the sake of the community, for the sake of the future,
p115
aVlet's stop fighting for a moment and start talking.
p116
aVBecause, the thing is,
p117
aVwhen we're involved in conflict,
p118
aVit's very easy to lose perspective.
p119
aVIt's very easy to react.
p120
aVHuman beings \u2014 we're reaction machines.
p121
aVAnd as the saying goes,
p122
aVwhen angry, you will make the best speech
p123
aVyou will ever regret.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd so the third side reminds us of that.
p128
aVThe third side helps us go to the balcony,
p129
aVwhich is a metaphor for a place of perspective,
p130
aVwhere we can keep our eyes on the prize.
p131
aa(lp132
VLet me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience.
p133
aVSome years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks
p134
aVbetween the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya.
p135
aVThere was a war going on, as you know.
p136
aVAnd we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace,
p137
aVin the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place.
p138
aVAnd the talks got off to a rather rocky start
p139
aVwhen the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians
p140
aVand said, "You should stay right here in your seats,
p141
aVbecause you're going to be on trial for war crimes."
p142
aVAnd then he turned to me and said,
p143
aV"You're an American.
p144
aVLook at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico."
p145
aVAnd my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?"
p146
aVI started reacting.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VBut then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony.
p151
aVAnd then when he paused
p152
aVand everyone looked at me for a response,
p153
aVfrom a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks
p154
aVand say, "I appreciate your criticism of my country
p155
aVand I take it as a sign that we're among friends
p156
aVand can speak candidly to one another."
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
V"And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.
p161
aVWe're here to see if we can figure out a way
p162
aVto stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya."
p163
aVThe conversation got back on track.
p164
aVThat's the role of the third side,
p165
aVto help the parties go to the balcony.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow let me take you, for a moment,
p168
aVto what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict,
p169
aVor the most impossible conflict, the Middle East.
p170
aVQuestion is: where's the third side there?
p171
aVHow could we possibly go to the balcony?
p172
aVNow, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict,
p173
aVbut I think I've got a first step \u2014 literally, a first step \u2014
p174
aVsomething that any one of us could do as third-siders.
p175
aVLet me just ask you one question first.
p176
aVHow many of you in the last years
p177
aVhave ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East
p178
aVand wondering what anyone could do?
p179
aVJust out of curiosity, how many of you?
p180
aVOK, so the great majority of us.
p181
aVAnd here, it's so far away.
p182
aVWhy do we pay so much attention to this conflict?
p183
aVIs it the number of deaths?
p184
aVThere are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa
p185
aVthan in the Middle East.
p186
aVNo, it's because of the story,
p187
aVbecause we feel personally involved in that story.
p188
aVWhether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious,
p189
aVwe feel we have a personal stake in it.
p190
aa(lp191
VStories matter;
p192
aVas an anthropologist, I know that.
p193
aVStories are what we use to transmit knowledge.
p194
aVThey give meaning to our lives.
p195
aVThat's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories.
p196
aVStories are the key.
p197
aVAnd so my question is \u2014
p198
aVyes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East,
p199
aVbut let's also take a look at the story.
p200
aVLet's try to get at the root of what it's all about.
p201
aVLet's see if we can apply the third side to it.
p202
aVWhat would that mean? What is the story there?
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story.
p205
aVWhat's the origin story of the Middle East?
p206
aVIn a phrase, it's:
p207
aVFour thousand years ago,
p208
aVa man and his family walked across the Middle East,
p209
aVand the world has never been the same since.
p210
aVThat man, of course, was Abraham.
p211
aVAnd what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family;
p212
aVhe's the father of us all.
p213
aVBut it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was.
p214
aVHis basic message was unity too,
p215
aVthe interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all.
p216
aVAnd his basic value was respect,
p217
aVwas kindness toward strangers.
p218
aVThat's what he's known for, his hospitality.
p219
aVSo in that sense,
p220
aVhe's the symbolic third side of the Middle East.
p221
aVHe's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole.
p222
aVNow, think about that for a moment.
p223
aa(lp224
VToday, we face the scourge of terrorism.
p225
aVWhat is terrorism?
p226
aVTerrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger
p227
aVand treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear.
p228
aVWhat's the opposite of terrorism?
p229
aVIt's taking an innocent stranger
p230
aVand treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home,
p231
aVin order to sow and create understanding
p232
aVor respect, or love.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo what if, then, you took the story of Abraham,
p235
aVwhich is a third-side story,
p236
aVwhat if that could be \u2014
p237
aVbecause Abraham stands for hospitality \u2014
p238
aVwhat if that could be an antidote to terrorism?
p239
aVWhat if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance?
p240
aVHow would you bring that story to life?
p241
aVNow, it's not enough just to tell a story.
p242
aVThat's powerful, but people need to experience the story.
p243
aVThey need to be able to live the story.
p244
aVHow would you do that?
p245
aVAnd that was my thinking of how would you do that.
p246
aVAnd that's what comes to the first step here.
p247
aVBecause the simple way to do that is:
p248
aVyou go for a walk.
p249
aVYou go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham.
p250
aVYou retrace the footsteps of Abraham.
p251
aVBecause walking has a real power.
p252
aVYou know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human.
p253
aVIt's funny \u2014 when you walk, you walk side-by-side,
p254
aVin the same common direction.
p255
aVNow if I were to come to you face-to-face
p256
aVand come this close to you,
p257
aVyou would feel threatened.
p258
aVBut if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,
p259
aVeven touching shoulders,
p260
aVit's no problem.
p261
aVWho fights while they walk?
p262
aVThat's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough,
p263
aVpeople go for walks in the woods.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path,
p266
aVa route \u2014 think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail \u2014
p267
aVthat followed in the footsteps of Abraham?
p268
aVPeople said, "That's crazy. You can't.
p269
aVYou can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham \u2014 it's too insecure,
p270
aVyou've got to cross all these borders,
p271
aVit goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East,
p272
aVbecause it unites them all."
p273
aVAnd so we studied the idea at Harvard.
p274
aVWe did our due diligence.
p275
aVAnd then a few years ago,
p276
aVa group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries,
p277
aVdecided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham,
p278
aVgoing from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa
p279
aVin Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.
p280
aVAnd we then took a bus and took some walks
p281
aVand went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey.
p282
aVThen we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo,
p283
aVwhich, turns out, is named after Abraham.
p284
aVWe went to Damascus,
p285
aVwhich has a long history associated with Abraham.
p286
aVWe then came to Northern Jordan,
p287
aVto Jerusalem \u2014 which is all about Abraham \u2014 to Bethlehem,
p288
aVand finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron.
p289
aVSo effectively, we went from womb to tomb.
p290
aVWe showed it could be done.
p291
aVIt was an amazing journey.
p292
aa(lp293
VLet me ask you a question.
p294
aVHow many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood
p295
aVor strange land,
p296
aVand a total stranger, perfect stranger,
p297
aVcomes up to you and shows you some kindness \u2014
p298
aVmaybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink,
p299
aVgives you a coffee, gives you a meal?
p300
aVHow many of you have ever had that experience?
p301
aVThat's the essence of the Abraham Path.
p302
aVThat's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East
p303
aVwhere you expect hostility,
p304
aVand you get the most amazing hospitality,
p305
aVall associated with Abraham:
p306
aV"In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food."
p307
aVSo what we discovered
p308
aVis that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people;
p309
aVhe's alive, he's a living presence.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd to make a long story short,
p312
aVin the last couple of years now,
p313
aVthousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham
p314
aVin the Middle East,
p315
aVenjoying the hospitality of the people there.
p316
aVThey've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine,
p317
aVin Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.
p318
aVIt's an amazing experience.
p319
aVMen, women, young people, old people \u2014
p320
aVmore women than men, actually, interestingly.
p321
aa(lp322
VFor those who can't walk,
p323
aVwho are unable to get there right now,
p324
aVpeople started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities.
p325
aVIn Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk
p326
aVfrom a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together.
p327
aVIt was Abraham Path Day.
p328
aVIn São Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event
p329
aVfor thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run,
p330
aVuniting the different communities.
p331
aVThe media love it; they really adore it.
p332
aVThey lavish attention on it because it's visual
p333
aVand it spreads the idea,
p334
aVthis idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers.
p335
aVAnd just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it.
p336
aVLast month,
p337
aVthere was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it,
p338
aVtwo whole pages.
p339
aVAnd they quoted a villager
p340
aVwho said, "This walk connects us to the world."
p341
aVHe said, "It was like a light that went on in our lives \u2014
p342
aVit brought us hope."
p343
aVAnd so that's what it's about.
p344
aa(lp345
VBut it's not just about psychology;
p346
aVit's about economics.
p347
aVBecause as people walk, they spend money.
p348
aVAnd this woman right here, Um Ahmad,
p349
aVis a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan.
p350
aVShe's desperately poor.
p351
aVShe's partially blind, her husband can't work,
p352
aVshe's got seven kids.
p353
aVBut what she can do is cook.
p354
aVAnd so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers
p355
aVwho come through the village and have a meal in her home.
p356
aVThey sit on the floor \u2014 she doesn't even have a tablecloth.
p357
aVShe makes the most delicious food,
p358
aVthat's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside.
p359
aVAnd so more and more walkers have come,
p360
aVand lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family.
p361
aVAnd so she told our team there, she said,
p362
aV"You have made me visible
p363
aVin a village where people were once ashamed to look at me."
p364
aVThat's the potential of the Abraham Path.
p365
aa(lp366
VThere are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities
p367
aVacross the Middle East, across the path.
p368
aVThe potential is basically to change the game.
p369
aVAnd to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things \u2014
p370
aVto change the frame from hostility to hospitality,
p371
aVfrom terrorism to tourism.
p372
aVAnd in that sense, the Abraham Path
p373
aVis a game-changer.
p374
aa(lp375
VLet me just show you one thing.
p376
aVI have a little acorn here
p377
aVthat I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year.
p378
aVNow, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course \u2014
p379
aVgrows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham.
p380
aVThe path right now is like an acorn;
p381
aVit's still in its early phase.
p382
aVWhat would the oak tree look like?
p383
aVWhen I think back to my childhood,
p384
aVa good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago,
p385
aVI spent in Europe.
p386
aVIf you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin,
p387
aVand you had said,
p388
aV"Sixty years from now,
p389
aVthis is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet,"
p390
aVpeople would have thought you were certifiably insane.
p391
aVBut they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe,
p392
aVand a common economy.
p393
aVSo my question is, if it can be done in Europe,
p394
aVwhy not in the Middle East?
p395
aVWhy not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham,
p396
aVand thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism?
p397
aa(lp398
VSo let me conclude, then,
p399
aVby saying that in the last 35 years,
p400
aVas I've worked in some of the most dangerous,
p401
aVdifficult and intractable conflicts around the planet,
p402
aVI have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed.
p403
aVIt's not easy, of course.
p404
aVBut it's possible.
p405
aVIt was done in South Africa.
p406
aVIt was done in Northern Ireland.
p407
aVIt could be done anywhere.
p408
aVIt simply depends on us.
p409
aVIt depends on us taking the third side.
p410
aVSo let me invite you to consider taking the third side,
p411
aVeven as a very small step.
p412
aVWe're about to take a break in a moment.
p413
aVJust go up to someone
p414
aVwho's from a different culture, a different country,
p415
aVa different ethnicity \u2014 some difference \u2014
p416
aVand engage them in a conversation.
p417
aVListen to them.
p418
aVThat's a third-side act.
p419
aVThat's walking Abraham's Path.
p420
aVAfter a TED Talk,
p421
aVwhy not a TED Walk?
p422
aa(lp423
V(Laughter)
p424
aa(lp425
VSo let me just leave you with three things.
p426
aVOne is, the secret to peace is the third side.
p427
aVThe third side is us.
p428
aVEach of us, with a single step,
p429
aVcan take the world, can bring the world
p430
aVa step closer to peace.
p431
aVThere's an old African proverb that goes:
