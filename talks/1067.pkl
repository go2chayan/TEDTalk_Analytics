VRunning: it's basically just right, left, right, left, yeah?
p5
aVI mean, we've been doing it for two million years,
p6
aVso it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say
p7
aVthat hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago.
p8
aVBut the cool thing about running, as I've discovered,
p9
aVis that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time.
p10
aVCase in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon,
p11
aVI guarantee you, you saw something that no one has ever seen before.
p12
aa(lp13
VAn Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line.
p14
aVShe's 37 years old.
p15
aVShe hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years,
p16
aVand a few months previously,
p17
aVshe had almost died in childbirth.
p18
aVDerartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport,
p19
aVbut she decided she'd go for broke
p20
aVand try for one last big payday in the marquee event,
p21
aVthe New York City Marathon.
p22
aVExcept \u2014 bad news for Derartu Tulu \u2014 some other people had the same idea,
p23
aVincluding the Olympic gold medalist,
p24
aVand Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,
p25
aVthe fastest woman marathoner in history by far.
p26
aVOnly 10 minutes off the men's world record,
p27
aVPaula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.
p28
aVThat's her competition.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe gun goes off, and \u2014 I mean, she's not even an underdog;
p31
aVshe's, like, under the underdogs.
p32
aVBut the under-underdog hangs tough,
p33
aVand 22 miles into a 26-mile race,
p34
aVthere is Derartu Tulu, up there with the lead pack.
p35
aVNow, this is when something really bizarre happens.
p36
aVPaula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck
p37
aVfrom Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,
p38
aVsuddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back.
p39
aVSo we all know what to do in this situation, right?
p40
aVYou give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow
p41
aVand blaze for the finish line.
p42
aVDerartu Tulu ruins the script.
p43
aVInstead of taking off,
p44
aVshe falls back and she grabs Paula Radcliffe,
p45
aVand says, "Come on. Come with us. You can do it."
p46
aVSo Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it.
p47
aVShe catches up with the lead pack
p48
aVand is pushing toward the finish line.
p49
aVBut then she falls back again.
p50
aVThe second time, Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her.
p51
aVAnd Paula Radcliffe, at that point, says, "I'm done. Go."
p52
aVSo that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends.
p53
aVShe loses the check,
p54
aVbut she goes home with something bigger and more important.
p55
aVExcept Derartu Tulu ruins the script again.
p56
aVInstead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins.
p57
aVWins the New York City Marathon,
p58
aVgoes home with a big fat check.
p59
aa(lp60
VIt's a heartwarming story,
p61
aVbut if you drill a little bit deeper,
p62
aVyou've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there.
p63
aVWhen you have two outliers in one organism,
p64
aVit's not a coincidence.
p65
aVWhen you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate
p66
aVthan anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence.
p67
aVYou show me a creature with webbed feet and gills;
p68
aVsomehow water's involved.
p69
aa(lp70
VSomeone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there.
p71
aVAnd the answer to it, I think, can be found
p72
aVdown in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,
p73
aVwhere there's a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians.
p74
aVNow, the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things.
p75
aVNumber one is:
p76
aVthey have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years.
p77
aVWhen the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices:
p78
aVyou either fight back and engage or you could take off.
p79
aVThe Mayans and Aztecs engaged,
p80
aVwhich is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs.
p81
aVThe Tarahumara had a different strategy.
p82
aVThey took off and hid
p83
aVin this labyrinthine, networking, spider-webbing system of canyons
p84
aVcalled the Copper Canyons.
p85
aVAnd there they've remained since the 1600s,
p86
aVessentially the same way they've always been.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is:
p89
aVdeep into old age \u2014 70 to 80 years old \u2014
p90
aVthese guys aren't running marathons;
p91
aVthey're running mega-marathons.
p92
aVThey're not doing 26 miles,
p93
aVthey're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,
p94
aVand apparently without injury, without problems.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is:
p97
aVall the things we're going to be talking about today,
p98
aVall the things we're trying to use all of our technology
p99
aVand brain power to solve \u2014
p100
aVthings like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer;
p101
aVcrime, warfare and violence; clinical depression \u2014 all this stuff \u2014
p102
aVthe Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about.
p103
aVThey are free from all of these modern ailments.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo what's the connection?
p106
aVAgain, we're talking about outliers;
p107
aVthere's got to be some kind of cause and effect.
p108
aVWell, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah
p109
aVthat are bending their brains and trying to figure out
p110
aVwhat the Tarahumara have known forever.
p111
aVThey're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries.
p112
aVAnd once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery \u2014
p113
aVperhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara
p114
aVis wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this:
p115
aVThree things \u2014 if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone,
p116
aVbecause nobody else knows the answer.
p117
aVIf you know it, you're smarter than anybody on planet Earth.
p118
aa(lp119
VMystery number one is this:
p120
aVTwo million years ago, the human brain exploded in size.
p121
aVAustralopithecus had a tiny little pea brain.
p122
aVSuddenly humans show up, Homo erectus, big old melon head.
p123
aVTo have a brain of that size,
p124
aVyou need to have a source of condensed caloric energy.
p125
aVIn other words, early humans are eating dead animals \u2014
p126
aVno argument, that's a fact.
p127
aVThe only problem is,
p128
aVthe first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo somehow, for nearly two million years,
p131
aVwe are killing animals without any weapons.
p132
aVNow, we're not using our strength,
p133
aVbecause we are the biggest sissies in the jungle.
p134
aVEvery other animal is stronger than we are,
p135
aVthey have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed.
p136
aVWe think Usain Bolt is fast.
p137
aVUsain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel.
p138
aVWe're not fast.
p139
aVThat would be an Olympic event:
p140
aVturn a squirrel loose, whoever catches it gets a gold medal.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSo no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws.
p145
aVHow were we killing these animals? Mystery number one.
p146
aa(lp147
VMystery number two:
p148
aVWomen have been in the Olympics for quite some time now,
p149
aVbut one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters:
p150
aVthey all suck; they're terrible.
p151
aVThere's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been.
p152
aVThe fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.
p153
aVI could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy
p154
aVwho can run faster than 4:15.
p155
aVFor some reason, you guys are just really slow.
p156
aVBut \u2014
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VBut, you get to the marathon we were just talking about \u2014
p161
aVyou've only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years,
p162
aVbecause prior to the 1980s, medical science said
p163
aVif a woman tried to run 26 miles \u2014 does anyone know what would happen
p164
aVif you tried to run 26 miles?
p165
aVWhy you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s?
p166
aa(lp167
VAudience Member: Her uterus would be torn.
p168
aa(lp169
VChristopher McDougall: Her uterus would be torn, yes.
p170
aVTorn reproductive organs.
p171
aVThe uterus would literally fall out of the body.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, I've been to a lot of marathons,
p176
aVand I've yet to see any ...
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VSo it's only been 20 years
p181
aVthat women have been allowed to run the marathon.
p182
aVIn that very short learning curve, you've gone from broken organs
p183
aVup to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record.
p184
aa(lp185
VThen you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance
p186
aVthat medical science also told us would be fatal to humans \u2014
p187
aVremember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles \u2014
p188
aVyou get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly, it's a different game.
p189
aVYou take a runner like Ann Trason or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,
p190
aVput them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world,
p191
aVand it's a coin toss who's going to win.
p192
aVI'll give you an example.
p193
aVA couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race
p194
aVcalled the Hardrock 100,
p195
aVwhich tells you all you need to know about the race.
p196
aVThey give you 48 hours to finish this race.
p197
aVWell, Emily Baer \u2014 500 runners \u2014
p198
aVshe finishes in eighth place, in the top 10,
p199
aVeven though she stopped at all the aid stations
p200
aVto breastfeed her baby during the race.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd yet, she beat 492 other people.
p205
aVThe last mystery:
p206
aVWhy is it that women get stronger as distances get longer?
p207
aVThe third mystery is this:
p208
aVAt the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times
p209
aVfor people running the marathon.
p210
aVWhat they found is that if you start running the marathon at age 19,
p211
aVyou'll get progressively faster, year by year,
p212
aVuntil you reach your peak at age 27.
p213
aVAnd then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time.
p214
aVAnd you'll get slower and slower,
p215
aVuntil eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19.
p216
aVSo about seven, eight years to reach your peak,
p217
aVand then gradually you fall off your peak,
p218
aVuntil you go back to the starting point.
p219
aVYou'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed,
p220
aVmaybe 10 years \u2014 no, it's 45 years.
p221
aV64-year-old men and women
p222
aVare running as fast as they were at age 19.
p223
aVNow, I defy you to come up with any other physical activity \u2014
p224
aVand please don't say golf \u2014 something that's actually hard \u2014
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
Vwhere geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo you have these three mysteries.
p231
aVIs there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up?
p232
aVYou've got to be careful anytime someone looks back in prehistory
p233
aVand tries to give you a global answer because,
p234
aVit being prehistory, you can say whatever the hell you want
p235
aVand get away with it.
p236
aVBut I'll submit this to you:
p237
aVIf you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle,
p238
aVsuddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture.
p239
aVIf you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight
p240
aVand don't die of heart disease,
p241
aVwhy a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu
p242
aVcan be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive,
p243
aVand why we somehow were able to find food without weapons,
p244
aVperhaps it's because humans,
p245
aVas much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe,
p246
aVactually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs.
p247
aa(lp248
VMaybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.
p249
aVBecause the one advantage we have in the wilderness \u2014
p250
aVagain, it's not our fangs, our claws or our speed \u2014
p251
aVthe only thing we do really well is sweat.
p252
aVWe're really good at being sweaty and smelly.
p253
aVBetter than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well.
p254
aVBut the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort
p255
aVis the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances,
p256
aVwe're superb \u2014 the best on the planet.
p257
aVYou take a horse on a hot day,
p258
aVand after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice:
p259
aVit's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off.
p260
aVBut it ain't doing both. We can.
p261
aVSo what if we evolved as hunting pack animals?
p262
aVWhat if the only natural advantage we had in the world
p263
aVwas the fact that we could get together as a group,
p264
aVgo out there on that African savanna, pick out an antelope,
p265
aVgo out as a pack, and run that thing to death?
p266
aVThat's all we could do.
p267
aVWe could run really far on a hot day.
p268
aa(lp269
VWell, if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well.
p270
aVThe key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack."
p271
aVIf you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope,
p272
aVI guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna.
p273
aVYou need a pack to pull together.
p274
aVYou need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds
p275
aVwho have been doing this for a long time
p276
aVto understand which antelope you're trying to catch.
p277
aVThe herd explodes and it gathers back again.
p278
aVThose expert trackers have to be part of the pack.
p279
aVThey can't be 10 miles behind.
p280
aVYou need the women and the adolescents there,
p281
aVbecause the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein
p282
aVis when you're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent.
p283
aVIt makes no sense to have the antelope over there, dead,
p284
aVand the people who want to eat it 50 miles away.
p285
aVThey need to be part of the pack.
p286
aVYou need those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers
p287
aVready to drop the kill,
p288
aVand you need those teenagers who are learning the whole thing involved.
p289
aVThe pack stays together.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnother thing that has to be true: this pack cannot be materialistic.
p292
aVYou can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope.
p293
aVYou can't be a pissed-off pack.
p294
aVYou can't be bearing grudges, like, "I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.
p295
aVHe pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope."
p296
aVThe pack has got to be able to swallow its ego,
p297
aVbe cooperative, and pull together.
p298
aVWhat you end up with, in other words,
p299
aVis a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara,
p300
aVa tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age.
p301
aVIt's a really compelling argument
p302
aVthat maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done
p303
aVfor two million years,
p304
aVthat it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path.
p305
aa(lp306
VYou know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing,
p307
aVthis punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before.
p308
aVBut maybe it's something different.
p309
aVMaybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had
p310
aVand we spoiled it.
p311
aVHow do we spoil it? Well, how do we spoil anything?
p312
aVWe try to cash in on it. Right?
p313
aVWe try to can it and package it and make it "better"
p314
aVand then sell it to people.
p315
aVAnd then what happened was, we started creating
p316
aVthese fancy cushioned things which can make running "better,"
p317
aVcalled running shoes.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes
p320
aVis because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt.
p321
aVAnd I think if anybody in here runs \u2014
p322
aVI just had a conversation with Carol.
p323
aVWe talked for two minutes backstage, and she talked about plantar fasciitis.
p324
aVYou talk to a runner, I guarantee within 30 seconds,
p325
aVthe conversation turns to injury.
p326
aVSo if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage,
p327
aVthen why are we so bad at it?
p328
aVWhy do we keep getting hurt?
p329
aa(lp330
VA curious thing about running and running injuries
p331
aVis that the running injury is new to our time.
p332
aVIf you read folklore and mythology,
p333
aVany kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,
p334
aVrunning is always associated with freedom and vitality
p335
aVand youthfulness and eternal vigor.
p336
aVIt's only in our lifetime that running has become associated
p337
aVwith fear and pain.
p338
aVGeronimo used to say, "My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs."
p339
aVThat's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles
p340
aVacross the desert,
p341
aVengage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses,
p342
aVand slap leather for home.
p343
aVGeronimo was never saying, "You know something, my Achilles \u2014 I'm tapering.
p344
aVI've got to take this week off."
p345
aVOr, "I need to cross-train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VHumans ran and ran all the time.
p350
aVWe are here today. We have our digital technology.
p351
aVAll of our science comes from the fact
p352
aVthat our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day,
p353
aVwhich was just rely on their naked feet and legs
p354
aVto run long distances.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo how do we get back to that again?
p357
aVWell, I would submit to you the first thing is:
p358
aVget rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing.
p359
aVGet rid of all the stinking running shoes.
p360
aVStop focusing on urban marathons,
p361
aVwhich, if you do four hours, you suck,
p362
aVand if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,
p363
aVbecause you qualified for another race.
p364
aVWe need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness
p365
aVand, I would say, nakedness,
p366
aVthat has made the Tarahumara
p367
aVone of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time.
p368
aVSo what's the benefit? So what?
p369
aVSo you burn off the Häagen-Dazs from the night before.
p370
aa(lp371
VBut maybe there's another benefit there as well.
p372
aVWithout getting too extreme about this,
p373
aVimagine a world where everybody could go out the door
p374
aVand engage in the kind of exercise
p375
aVthat's going to make them more relaxed, more serene,
p376
aVmore healthy,
p377
aVburn off stress \u2014
p378
aVwhere you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore,
p379
aVor go home with a lot of stress on top of you again.
p380
aVMaybe there's something between what we are today
p381
aVand what the Tarahumara have always been.
p382
aVI don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons
p383
aVand live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,
p384
aVbut maybe there's somewhere in between.
p385
aVAnd if we find that thing,
p386
aVmaybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there.
p387
aVBecause if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability
p388
aVthat we all enjoyed for most of our existence
p389
aVup until the 1970s or so,
p390
aVthe benefits \u2014 social and physical and political and mental \u2014
p391
aVcould be astounding.
p392
aa(lp393
VWhat I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture
p394
aVof barefoot runners, people who've gotten rid of their shoes.
p395
aVAnd what they have found uniformly is,
p396
aVyou get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress,
p397
aVyou get rid of the injuries and the ailments.
p398
aVAnd what you find is something the Tarahumara have known
p399
aVfor a very long time:
p400
aVthat this can be a whole lot of fun.
p401
aVI've experienced it personally myself.
p402
aVI was injured all my life; then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes
p403
aVand my running ailments have gone away, too.
p404
aa(lp405
VSo hopefully it's something we can all benefit from.
p406
aVI appreciate your listening to this story.
p407
aa(lp408
VThanks very much.
