VLadies and gentlemen,
p5
aVI present to you the human genome.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Applause)
p8
aa(lp9
VChromosome one \u2014 top left, bottom right \u2014 are the sex chromosomes.
p10
aVWomen have two copies of that big X chromosome;
p11
aVmen have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
p12
aVSorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.
p13
aVSo if you zoom in on this genome,
p14
aVthen what you see, of course, is this double-helix structure \u2014
p15
aVthe code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters,
p16
aVor we call them bases: A, C, G and T.
p17
aVHow many are there in the human genome? Three billion.
p18
aVIs that a big number?
p19
aVWell, everybody can throw around big numbers.
p20
aVBut in fact, if I were to place one base
p21
aVon each pixel of this 1280x800-resolution screen,
p22
aVwe would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
p23
aVSo it's really quite big.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd perhaps because of its size,
p26
aVa group of people \u2014 all, by the way, with Y chromosomes \u2014
p27
aVdecided they would want to sequence it.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later,
p32
aVthe genome was sequenced and published.
p33
aVIn 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
p34
aVThat was all done on a machine like this.
p35
aVIt costs about a dollar for each base \u2014 a very slow way of doing it.
p36
aa(lp37
VWell, folks, I'm here to tell you
p38
aVthat the world has completely changed,
p39
aVand none of you know about it.
p40
aVSo now what we do is take a genome,
p41
aVwe make maybe 50 copies of it,
p42
aVwe cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads,
p43
aVand then we sequence them, massively parallel.
p44
aVThen we bring that into software and reassemble it,
p45
aVand tell you what the story is.
p46
aVSo to give you a picture of what this looks like,
p47
aVthe Human Genome Project: 3 gigabases, right?
p48
aVOne run on one of these modern machines: 200 gigabases in a week.
p49
aVAnd that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer,
p50
aVand there's no sign of this pace slowing.
p51
aVThe price of a base, to sequence a base,
p52
aVhas fallen 100 million times.
p53
aVThat's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998,
p54
aVwaiting until 2011,
p55
aVand now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VWorld population,
p60
aVPC placements,
p61
aVthe archive of all of medical literature,
p62
aVMoore's law,
p63
aVthe old way of sequencing,
p64
aVand here's all the new stuff.
p65
aVGuys, this is a long scale;
p66
aVyou don't typically see lines that go up like that.
p67
aVSo the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes
p68
aVis something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.
p69
aVWe know this based on the machines that are being placed.
p70
aVThis is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple
p71
aVyear over year for the foreseeable future.
p72
aVIn fact, there's one lab in particular
p73
aVthat represents 20 percent of all that capacity:
p74
aVIt's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.
p75
aVThe Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.
p76
aVWhat does this mean for medicine?
p77
aa(lp78
VSo a woman, age 37,
p79
aVpresents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
p80
aVShe is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.
p81
aVShe goes home.
p82
aVTwo years later,
p83
aVshe comes back with stage 3C ovarian cancer, unfortunately;
p84
aVtreated again with surgery and chemotherapy.
p85
aVShe comes back three years later at age 42
p86
aVwith more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.
p87
aVSix months later,
p88
aVshe comes back with acute myeloid leukemia.
p89
aVShe goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo first: the way in which this woman was treated,
p92
aVin as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting.
p93
aVAnd it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson,
p94
aVat the Genome Institute at Washington University,
p95
aVwho decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
p96
aVAnd he took skin cells, healthy skin
p97
aVand cancerous bone marrow,
p98
aVand sequenced the whole genomes of both of them
p99
aVin a couple of weeks, no big deal.
p100
aVThen he compared those two genomes in software,
p101
aVand what he found, among other things,
p102
aVwas a deletion \u2014 a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases
p103
aVin a particular gene called TP53.
p104
aVIf you have this deleterious mutation in this gene,
p105
aVyou're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman,
p108
aVbut it does have severe \u2014 profound, if you will \u2014
p109
aVimplications to her family.
p110
aVI mean, if they have the same mutation,
p111
aVand they get this genetic test and they understand it,
p112
aVthen they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early,
p113
aVand potentially live a significantly longer life.
p114
aa(lp115
VLet me introduce you to the Beery twins,
p116
aVdiagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.
p117
aVTheir mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe it;
p118
aVthe symptoms weren't matching up.
p119
aVAnd through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching,
p120
aVshe was able to convince the medical community
p121
aVthat, in fact, they had something else.
p122
aVThey had dopa-responsive dystonia.
p123
aVAnd so they were given L-Dopa,
p124
aVand their symptoms did improve,
p125
aVbut they weren't totally asymptomatic.
p126
aVSignificant problems remained.
p127
aa(lp128
VTurns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery,
p129
aVwho was lucky enough to be the CIO
p130
aVof a company called Life Technologies.
p131
aVThey're one of two companies
p132
aVthat makes these massive whole-genome sequencing tools.
p133
aVAnd so he got his kids sequenced.
p134
aVWhat they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR,
p135
aVwhich is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
p136
aVSo on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug,
p137
aVand they're effectively normal now.
p138
aVGuys, this would never have happened without whole-genome sequencing.
p139
aVAt the time \u2014 this was a few years ago \u2014 it cost $100,000.
p140
aVToday it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,
p141
aVthe year after, $100, give or take a year.
p142
aVThat's how fast this is moving.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo here's little Nick \u2014
p145
aVlikes Batman and squirt guns.
p146
aVAnd it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital
p147
aVwith this distended belly, like a famine victim.
p148
aVAnd it's not that he's not eating; it's that when he eats,
p149
aVhis intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut.
p150
aVSo a hundred surgeries later,
p151
aVhe looks at his mom and says, "Mom, please pray for me.
p152
aVI'm in so much pain."
p153
aVHis pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics
p154
aVand he has no idea what's going on,
p155
aVbut he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced."
p156
aVAnd what they find is a single-point mutation
p157
aVin a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.
p158
aVSo the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction
p159
aVto what's going on \u2014 to the food, essentially.
p160
aVAnd that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death,
p161
aVbut the gene that regulates that down is broken.
p162
aVAnd so this informs, among other things, of course,
p163
aVa treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.
p164
aVAnd after nine months of grueling recovery,
p165
aVhe's now eating steak with A1 sauce.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThe prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic
p170
aVis upon us today.
p171
aVToday. It's here.
p172
aVAnd what it means for all of us
p173
aVis that everybody in this room could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,
p174
aVjust because of this one thing.
p175
aVWhich is a fantastic story,
p176
aVunless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet,
p177
aVand our ability to keep up food production.
p178
aVSo it turns out
p179
aVthat the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines
p180
aVof corn, wheat, soybean and other crops
p181
aVthat are highly tolerant of drought, of flood,
p182
aVof pests and pesticides.
p183
aVNow, look \u2014
p184
aVas long as we continue to increase the population,
p185
aVwe'll have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods.
p186
aVAnd that's the only position I'll take today.
p187
aVUnless there's anybody in the audience
p188
aVwho'd like to volunteer to stop eating?
p189
aVNone, not one.
p190
aa(lp191
VThis is a typewriter,
p192
aVa staple of every desktop for decades.
p193
aVAnd, in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
p194
aVAnd then more general versions of word processors came about.
p195
aVBut ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption.
p196
aVIt was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet,
p197
aVand the connection of all these computers
p198
aVthat fundamentally changed everything.
p199
aVSuddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.
p200
aVAnd we had, indeed, the entire dot-com bubble.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VNot to worry though,
p205
aVthat was quickly rescued by the iPod, Facebook
p206
aVand, indeed, Angry Birds.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VLook, this is where we are today.
p211
aVThis is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are.
p212
aVWhat I'd like you to consider is:
p213
aVWhat does it mean
p214
aVwhen these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome,
p215
aVbut they connect to genomes all across the planet?
p216
aVI just recently had to buy life insurance, and I was required to answer:
p217
aVA. I have never had a genetic test;
p218
aVB. I've had one, here you go;
p219
aVor C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
p220
aVThankfully, I was able to answer A,
p221
aVand I say that honestly, in case my life insurance agent is listening.
p222
aVBut what would have happened if I had said C?
p223
aa(lp224
VConsumer applications for genomics will flourish.
p225
aVDo you want to see if you're genetically compatible
p226
aVwith your girlfriend?
p227
aVDNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VPersonalized genomic massage, anyone?
p232
aVThere's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,
p233
aVthe so-called cheating gene.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VSo anybody who's here today with your significant other,
p238
aVjust turn over to them, swab their mouth, send it to the lab
p239
aVand you'll know for sure.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VDo you really want to elect a president
p244
aVwhose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
p245
aVThink of it \u2014 it's 2016,
p246
aVand the leading candidate releases
p247
aVnot only her four years of back-tax returns,
p248
aVbut also her personal genome.
p249
aVAnd it looks really good.
p250
aVThen she challenges all her competitors to do the same.
p251
aVDo you think that's not going to happen?
p252
aVDo you think it would have helped John McCain?
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VHow many people in the audience have the last name Resnick, like me?
p257
aVRaise your hand.
p258
aVAnybody? Nobody.
p259
aVTypically, there's one or two.
p260
aVSo my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
p261
aVThey all hated each other, and all moved to different parts of the planet.
p262
aVSo it's likely I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet,
p263
aVbut I don't know.
p264
aVSo imagine if my genome were De-identified, sitting in software,
p265
aVAnd a third cousin's genome was also sitting there,
p266
aVand there was software that could compare the two
p267
aVand make these associations.
p268
aVNot hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now.
p269
aVImagine one more thing,
p270
aVthat that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent:
p271
aV"Would you be willing to meet your third cousin?"
p272
aVAnd if we both say yes \u2014 voilà!
p273
aVWelcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VNow this is probably a good thing, right?
p278
aVBigger clan gatherings and so on.
p279
aVBut maybe it's a bad thing as well.
p280
aVHow many fathers in the room? Raise your hands.
p281
aVOK, so experts think that one to three percent of you
p282
aVare not actually the father of your child.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VLook \u2014
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VThese genomes, these 23 chromosomes,
p291
aVthey don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships
p292
aVor the nature of our society \u2014 at least not yet.
p293
aVAnd like any new technology,
p294
aVit's really in humanity's hands
p295
aVto wield it for the betterment of mankind
p296
aVor not.
p297
aVAnd so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in
p298
aVand to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.
p299
aa(lp300
VThank you.
