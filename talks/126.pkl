VI'd like to start tonight by something completely different,
p5
aVasking you to join me by stepping off the land
p6
aVand jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
p7
aV90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,
p8
aVand it's where life \u2014 the title of our seminar tonight \u2014 it's where life began.
p9
aVAnd it's a lively and a lovely place,
p10
aVbut we're rapidly changing the oceans with our \u2014
p11
aVnot only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,
p12
aVour adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,
p13
aVbut also, most recently, with climate change,
p14
aVand Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
p15
aVNow, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,
p16
aVmore and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating
p17
aVwill be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
p18
aVAnd this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,
p21
aVand you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,
p22
aVbut they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi
p23
aVis just not going to fill you up.
p24
aVAbout 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
p25
aVSo it may be good for the waistline,
p26
aVbut it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
p27
aVAnd a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish
p28
aVisn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,
p29
aVthat is, unless you eat jellyfish.
p30
aVAnd this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack
p31
aVon this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
p32
aVAnd that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,
p33
aVwhose primary prey are jellyfish.
p34
aa(lp35
VThis animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records"
p36
aVfor being the world's heaviest bony fish.
p37
aVIt reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds \u2014 on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
p38
aVAnd I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here
p39
aVthat the Mola mola \u2014 its common name is sunfish \u2014
p40
aVthat its favorite food is the moon jelly.
p41
aVSo it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,
p42
aVeven if one is eating the other.
p43
aVNow this is typically how you see sunfish,
p44
aVthis is where they get their common name.
p45
aVThey like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
p46
aVThey just lay out on the surface of the sea
p47
aVand most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,
p48
aVthey lie out and bask on the surface.
p49
aa(lp50
VTheir other name, Mola mola, is \u2014 it sounds Hawaiian,
p51
aVbut it's actually Latin for millstone,
p52
aVand that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
p53
aVIt's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
p54
aVAnd that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,
p55
aVwas this terribly bizarre shape.
p56
aVYou know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,
p57
aVand you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes \u2014
p58
aVthey just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,
p59
aVand then you look at the sunfish.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just \u2014
p64
aVit really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
p65
aVSo I was just intrigued with what \u2014 you know, what is this animal's story?
p66
aVWell, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense
p67
aVexcept in the light of evolution.
p68
aVThe Mola's no exception.
p69
aVThey appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,
p70
aV65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,
p71
aVand they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction \u2014
p72
aVoblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
p73
aVOf course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,
p74
aVabout 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction
p75
aVthat said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs \u2014
p76
aVwe're going to head to the high seas.
p77
aVAnd lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,
p78
aVand we turn our puffer into the Mola.
p79
aVYou know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
p80
aa(lp81
VThey look \u2014 maybe they look
p82
aVkind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,
p83
aVbut in fact, in fact they are the \u2014
p84
aVthey vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,
p85
aVright up there with flat fish.
p86
aVThey're \u2014 every single thing about that fish has been changed.
p87
aVAnd in terms of fishes \u2014
p88
aVfishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,
p89
aVjust 50 million years ago, so \u2014
p90
aVso interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
p91
aVThey start as little eggs,
p92
aVand they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again
p93
aVfor having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
p94
aVA single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,
p95
aVcan carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries \u2014 imagine \u2014
p96
aVand they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
p97
aVAnd from that little egg,
p98
aVthey pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,
p99
aVand develop \u2014 this is their little adolescent stage.
p100
aVThey school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
p101
aVThat's a little diver up there in the corner.
p102
aa(lp103
VThey're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again
p104
aVfor being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
p105
aVFrom their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage
p106
aVtill they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
p107
aV600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,
p108
aVand you had to feed this thing.
p109
aVThat would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
p110
aVNow I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but \u2014
p111
aVwe don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,
p112
aVbut captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium \u2014
p113
aVone of the first places to have them in captivity \u2014
p114
aVthey had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
p115
aVI said, now, that's a true American.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)
p120
aa(lp121
VSo being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,
p122
aVbecause schooling used to be salvation for fishes,
p123
aVbut it's suicide for fishes now.
p124
aVBut unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,
p125
aVthey still get caught in nets as by-catch.
p126
aVIf we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,
p127
aVthen we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators \u2014
p128
aVhow they live their lives, like the Mola.
p129
aVAnd unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch \u2014
p130
aVup to 26 percent of the drift net.
p131
aVAnd in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,
p132
aVthey make up up to 90 percent.
p133
aVSo we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
p134
aVAnd how do you do that?
p135
aVHow do you do that with an animal \u2014 very few places in the world.
p136
aVThis is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries \u2014 it doesn't go to land.
p137
aa(lp138
VHow do you get insight?
p139
aVHow do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
p140
aVWell, there's some great new technology
p141
aVthat has just recently become available,
p142
aVand it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
p143
aVAnd it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
p144
aVThat little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,
p145
aVwhich is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
p146
aVAnd it can record this data for up to two years,
p147
aVand keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,
p148
aVfloat to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,
p149
aVto satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,
p150
aVand we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have \u2014
p151
aVwe just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
p152
aVSo the great thing about the Mola
p153
aVis that when we put the tag on them \u2014 if you look up here \u2014
p154
aVthat's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
p155
aVAnd it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
p156
aa(lp157
VMolas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.
p158
aVThey're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
p159
aVI think Donne wrote a poem about that.
p160
aVBut they have 40 genera of parasites,
p161
aVand so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
p162
aVAnd they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
p163
aVThey don't seem to mind, so far.
p164
aVSo what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
p165
aVWe're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
p166
aVAnd we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,
p167
aVusing temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
p168
aVWe'd love to tag in Monterey.
p169
aVMonterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
p170
aVNot this time of year \u2014 it's more around October.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd we'd love to tag here \u2014 this is an aerial shot of Monterey \u2014
p173
aVbut unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this
p174
aVbecause another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
p175
aVThe California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,
p176
aVrips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,
p177
aVand then tosses them back and forth.
p178
aVAnd I'm not exaggerating, it is just \u2014
p179
aVand sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
p180
aVAnd you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,
p181
aVit's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
p182
aVThe poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,
p183
aVso we head down south, to San Diego.
p184
aVNot so many California sea lions down there.
p185
aVAnd the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,
p186
aVand they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
p187
aVAnd under those kelps \u2014 this is why the Molas come there
p188
aVbecause it's spa time for the Molas there.
p189
aVAs soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
p190
aVAnd they come and give the Molas \u2014
p191
aVyou can see they strike this funny little position that says,
p192
aV"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,
p197
aVand the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean \u2014
p198
aVbecause the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
p199
aVAnd it's also a great place to go down south
p200
aVbecause the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
p201
aVI mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,
p202
aVwill say, "Okay, scratch me right there."
p203
aVYou truly can swim up to a Mola \u2014 they're very gentle \u2014
p204
aVand if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
p205
aVSo we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;
p206
aVwe've gone over to another part of the Pacific,
p207
aVand we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
p208
aVAnd over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
p209
aVAnd they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
p210
aVWe were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
p211
aVWell, not the one we tagged!
p212
aVAnd everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,
p213
aVto the fin muscle to \u2014 I think that ís pretty much the whole fish \u2014 is eaten.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo the hardest part of tagging, now, is
p216
aVafter you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
p217
aVAnd you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,
p218
aVI hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out
p219
aVduring the course that the tag is recording.
p220
aVThe tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,
p221
aVso you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
p222
aVAnd so the waiting is really the hardest part.
p223
aVI'm going to show you our latest dataset.
p224
aVAnd it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
p225
aVAnd in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,
p226
aVwe're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
p227
aVDo they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
p228
aVAnd we found that they kind of are homebodies.
p229
aVThey're not big migrators. This is their track:
p230
aVwe deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month
p231
aVkind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
p232
aVAnd after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
p233
aVAnd that's kind of their home range.
p234
aVNow that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,
p235
aVthat population doesn't get replenished.
p236
aVSo that's a very important piece of data.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.
p239
aVThey're super industrious.
p240
aVAnd this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we \u2014
p241
aVthey're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up
p242
aVand up and down, up to 40 times a day.
p243
aVAs the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
p244
aVDown \u2014 and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
p245
aVThey plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,
p246
aVand this is why you see them on the surface \u2014 it's so cold down there.
p247
aVThey've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,
p248
aVand then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
p249
aVAnd they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer \u2014
p250
aVwhich a whole variety of food's in that layer.
p251
aVSo rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,
p252
aVthey're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance
p253
aVbetween the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
p254
aa(lp255
VWe see the same pattern \u2014 now with these tags
p256
aVwe're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,
p257
aVa real three-dimensional play.
p258
aVThis is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,
p259
aVwhere they're going to be tagging all over the world
p260
aVand the Mola's going to enter into that.
p261
aVAnd what's exciting \u2014 you all travel, and you know
p262
aVthe best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,
p263
aVand to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
p264
aVWell now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals
p265
aVand explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
p266
aVIt's never \u2014 it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
p267
aa(lp268
VWhich brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.
p269
aVI set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
p270
aVAnd so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,
p271
aVand I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
p272
aVBut people would write into the site with all sorts of,
p273
aVall sorts of stories about these animals
p274
aVand wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
p275
aVAnd what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared \u2014
p276
aVa shared love and an interest in the oceans.
p277
aVI was getting reports from Catholic nuns,
p278
aVJewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians \u2014 everybody writing in,
p279
aVunited by their love of life.
p280
aVAnd to me that \u2014 I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:
p281
aV"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."
p282
aVAnd sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
p283
aVIf it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
