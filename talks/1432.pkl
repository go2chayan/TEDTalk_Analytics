VWhen we think of games, there's all kinds of things.
p5
aVMaybe you're ticked off, or maybe, you're looking forward to a new game.
p6
aVYou've been up too late playing a game.
p7
aVAll these things happen to me.
p8
aVBut when we think about games,
p9
aVa lot of times we think about stuff like this:
p10
aVfirst-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games,
p11
aVor maybe you're a Facebook game player.
p12
aVThis is one my partner and I worked on.
p13
aVMaybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now.
p14
aVThis is a lighter form of game.
p15
aVMaybe you think about the tragically boring board games
p16
aVthat hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations.
p17
aVThis would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out.
p18
aVOr maybe you're in your living room,
p19
aVplaying with the Wii with the kids,
p20
aVand there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about.
p21
aVI make my living from games, I've been lucky enough to do this
p22
aVsince I was 15, which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable,
p25
aVbut let's just think about this.
p26
aVSo this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.
p27
aVNow I don't know where you guys were,
p28
aVbut I was in my living room.
p29
aVIt was practically a religious event.
p30
aVAnd this is when the Americans beat the Russians,
p31
aVand this was \u2014 yes, it was technically a game.
p32
aVHockey is a game.
p33
aVBut really, was this a game?
p34
aVI mean, people cried.
p35
aVI've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aVAnd so this was an amazing experience.
p39
aa(lp40
VOr, if anybody here is from Boston \u2014
p41
aVSo when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series
p42
aVafter I believe, 351 years \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
Vwhen they won the World Series, it was amazing.
p47
aVI happened to be living in Springfield at the time,
p48
aVand the best part of it was,
p49
aVyou would close the women's door in the bathroom,
p50
aVand I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really?
p51
aVOr the houses, you'd come out, because every game,
p52
aVwell, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right?
p53
aVSo we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on in the whole block.
p54
aVAnd kids \u2014 the attendance was down in school,
p55
aVkids weren't going to school, but it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?
p56
aVI mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox,
p57
aVand we know where they're stacked.
p58
aVSo this was an amazing experience,
p59
aVand again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles,
p60
aVpeople didn't say, "You know, really, I can die now, because the Red Sox won."
p61
aVAnd many people did.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo games, it means something more to us.
p64
aVIt absolutely means something more.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo now, this is an abrupt transition here.
p67
aVThere was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of.
p68
aVI was the head of a college department teaching games,
p69
aVso, again, it was sort of a real job,
p70
aVand now I got to talk about making them as opposed to making them.
p71
aVPart of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department,
p72
aVis to eat, and I did that very well \u2014
p73
aVand so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson.
p74
aVSo this is Zig in this photograph, this is also one of Zig's photographs.
p75
aVHe's a photographer.
p76
aVAnd he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself,
p77
aVand you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation.
p78
aVAnd this particular shot \u2014
p79
aVthis is one of the more traditional shots.
p80
aVThis is a rain dancer.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd this is one of my favorite shots here.
p83
aVSo you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this.
p84
aVThis is an expression of culture, right?
p85
aVAnd this is actually from his Degradation series.
p86
aVAnd what was most fascinating to me about this series
p87
aVis just, look at that little boy there, can you imagine?
p88
aVWe can see that's a traditional Native American.
p89
aVNow I just want to change that guy's race.
p90
aVJust imagine if that's a black guy.
p91
aVSo, "Honey, come here, let's get you a picture with the black guy." Right?
p92
aVLike, seriously, nobody would do this.
p93
aVIt baffles the mind.
p94
aVAnd so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind.
p95
aVHis favorite photograph \u2014
p96
aVmy favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here \u2014
p97
aVis Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VSo I happen to be at dinner with this photographer,
p102
aVand he was talking with another photographer
p103
aVabout a shooting that had occurred,
p104
aVand it was on an Indian Reservation.
p105
aVHe'd taken his camera up there to photograph it,
p106
aVbut when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it.
p107
aVHe just couldn't capture the picture.
p108
aVAnd so they were talking back and forth about this question.
p109
aVDo you take the picture or not?
p110
aVAnd that was fascinating to me as a game designer,
p111
aVbecause it never occurs to me,
p112
aVshould I make the game about this difficult topic or not?
p113
aVBecause we just make things that are fun
p114
aVor will make you feel fear, that visceral excitement.
p115
aVBut every other medium does it.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo this is my kid.
p118
aVThis is Maezza, and when she was seven years old,
p119
aVshe came home from school one day,
p120
aVand like I do every single day, I asked her, "What did you do today?"
p121
aVSo she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage."
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black,
p124
aVand I knew this day was coming.
p125
aVI wasn't expecting it at seven, I don't know why, but I wasn't.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?"
p128
aVSo she proceeded to tell me,
p129
aVand so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.
p130
aV"The ships start in England, they come down from England,
p131
aVthey go to Africa, they go across the ocean \u2014
p132
aVthat's the Middle Passage part \u2014
p133
aVthey come to America, where the slaves are sold," she's telling me.
p134
aVBut Abraham Lincoln was elected president,
p135
aVand then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation,
p136
aVand now they're free.
p137
aa(lp138
VPause for about 10 seconds.
p139
aa(lp140
V"Can I play a game, Mommy?"
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd I thought, that's it? And so, you know,
p143
aVthis is the Middle Passage, this is an incredibly significant event,
p144
aVand she's treating it like, basically some black people went on a cruise,
p145
aVthis is more or less how it sounds to her.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd so, to me, I wanted more value in this,
p150
aVso when she asked if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd so I happened to have all of these little pieces.
p155
aVI'm a game designer, so I have this stuff sitting around my house.
p156
aVI said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these,
p157
aVand I tell her to paint them in different families.
p158
aVThese are pictures of Maezza when she was \u2014
p159
aVGod, it still chokes me up seeing these.
p160
aVSo she's painting her little families.
p161
aVSo then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.
p162
aVThis was the boat, it was made quickly, obviously.
p163
aVAnd so the basic gist of it is, I grabbed a bunch of families,
p164
aVand she's like, "Mommy, but you forgot the pink baby
p165
aVand you forgot the blue daddy
p166
aVand you forgot all these other things."
p167
aVAnd she says, "They want to go."
p168
aVAnd I said, "Honey, no, they don't want to go.
p169
aVThis is the Middle Passage, Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage."
p170
aVSo she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother,
p171
aVand as we're going across the ocean, following these rules,
p172
aVshe realizes that she's rolling pretty high,
p173
aVand she says to me, "We're not going to make it."
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd she realizes, we don't have enough food,
p176
aVand so she asks what to do,
p177
aVand I say \u2014 remember, she's seven \u2014
p178
aV"We can either put some people in the water
p179
aVor we can hope that they don't get sick
p180
aVand we make it to the other side."
p181
aVJust the look on her face came over \u2014
p182
aVnow mind you this is after a month of \u2014
p183
aVthis is Black History Month, right?
p184
aVAfter a month, she says to me, "Did this really happen?"
p185
aVAnd I said, "Yes." And so she said \u2014
p186
aVthis is her brother and sister \u2014
p187
aV"If I came out of the woods, Avalon and Donovan might be gone."
p188
aV"Yes."
p189
aV"But I'd get to see them in America."
p190
aV"No."
p191
aV"But what if I saw them? Couldn't we stay together?"
p192
aV"So Daddy could be gone."
p193
aV"Yes."
p194
aVShe was fascinated by this, and she started to cry,
p195
aVI started to cry, her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.
p196
aVHe didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd so, we made this game, and she got it.
p199
aVShe got it because she spent time with these people.
p200
aVIt wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd so it was just an incredibly powerful experience.
p203
aVThis is the game, which I've ended up calling "The New World,"
p204
aVbecause I like the phrase.
p205
aVI don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting
p206
aVto the people who were brought over on slave ships.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut when this happened, I saw the whole planet; I was so excited.
p209
aVI'd been making games for 20-some years,
p210
aVand then I decided to do it again.
p211
aVMy history is Irish.
p212
aVSo this is a game called "Síochán Leat." It's "peace be with you."
p213
aVIt's the entire history of my family in a single game.
p214
aa(lp215
VI made another game called "Train."
p216
aVI was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics,
p217
aVand if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover,
p218
aVand I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd I also made a game about the Trail of Tears.
p221
aVThis is a game with 50,000 individual pieces.
p222
aVI was crazy when I decided to start it, but I'm in the middle of it now.
p223
aVIt's the same thing.
p224
aVI'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd the one I'm working on right now, which is \u2014
p227
aVbecause I'm right in the middle of it,
p228
aVand these for some reason choke me up like crazy \u2014
p229
aVis a game called "Mexican Kitchen Workers."
p230
aVAnd originally, it was a math problem, more or less.
p231
aVHere's the economics of illegal immigration.
p232
aVAnd the more I learned about Mexican culture \u2014
p233
aVmy partner is Mexican \u2014 the more I learned that,
p234
aVyou know, for all of us, food is a basic need,
p235
aVand it is obviously with Mexicans, too, but it's much more than that.
p236
aVIt's an expression of love. It's an expression of \u2014
p237
aVGod, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought.
p238
aVI'll look away from the picture.
p239
aVIt's an expression of beauty, it's how they say they love you.
p240
aVIt's how they say they care,
p241
aVand you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother
p242
aVwithout saying "food" in the first sentence.
p243
aVAnd so to me, this beautiful culture,
p244
aVthis beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics,
p247
aVit changes our perceptions about those people in topics,
p248
aVand it changes ourselves.
p249
aVWe change as people through games,
p250
aVbecause we're involved, and we're playing,
p251
aVand we're learning as we do so.
p252
aa(lp253
VThank you.
