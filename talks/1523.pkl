VIn the past several days, I heard people talking about China.
p5
aVAnd also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.
p6
aVSomething is very challenging to me.
p7
aVI want to make my friends understand:
p8
aVChina is complicated.
p9
aVSo I always want to tell the story, like,
p10
aVone hand it is that, the other hand is that.
p11
aVYou can't just tell a one sided story.
p12
aVI'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.
p13
aVBRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China.
p14
aVThis emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.
p15
aVBut at the same time, on the other hand,
p16
aVChina is a SICK country,
p17
aVthe terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers \u2014 file.
p18
aVHe said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea.
p19
aVThe four countries have no access to Facebook.
p20
aVSo basically, China is a SICK BRIC country.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnother project was built up
p25
aVto watch China and Chinese Internet.
p26
aVAnd now, today I want to tell you my personal
p27
aVobservation in the past several years, from that wall.
p28
aVSo, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones,
p29
aVyou definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.
p30
aVIt prevents weird things from the north.
p31
aa(lp32
VSame was true for China.
p33
aVIn the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.
p34
aVIt protected China from invaders for 2,000 years.
p35
aVBut China also has a great firewall.
p36
aVThat's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world.
p37
aVIt's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas,
p38
aVfrom the universal values, but also to prevent
p39
aVChina's own citizens to access the global free Internet,
p40
aVand even separate themselves into blocks, not united.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, basically the "Internet" has two Internets.
p43
aVOne is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet.
p44
aVBut if you think the Chinanet is something
p45
aVlike a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong.
p46
aVBut we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game,
p47
aVto describe in the past 15 years
p48
aVthe continuing fight between Chinese
p49
aVcensorship, government censorship, the cat,
p50
aVand the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.
p51
aVBut sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.
p54
aVIn China, we have 500 million Internet users.
p55
aVThat's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world.
p56
aVSo even though China's is a totally censored Internet,
p57
aVbut still, Chinese Internet society is really booming.
p58
aVHow to make it? It's simple.
p59
aVYou have Google, we have Baidu.
p60
aVYou have Twitter, we have Weibo.
p61
aVYou have Facebook, we have Renren.
p62
aVYou have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou.
p63
aVThe Chinese government blocked every
p64
aVsingle international Web 2.0 service,
p65
aVand we Chinese copycat every one.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VSo, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.
p70
aVThat's not only to censor you.
p71
aVSometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple:
p72
aVBlock and clone.
p73
aVOn the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network,
p74
aVwhich is very important; people really love social networking.
p75
aVBut on the other hand, they want to keep the server
p76
aVin Beijing so they can access the data any time they want.
p77
aVThat's also the reason Google was pulled out from China,
p78
aVbecause they can't accept the fact
p79
aVthat Chinese government wants to keep the server.
p80
aa(lp81
VSometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.
p82
aVFor example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet.
p83
aVHe wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him.
p84
aVBut once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street.
p85
aVAnd now the result is very simple.
p86
aVWe all know Mubarak is technically dead.
p87
aVBut also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president,
p88
aVdidn't follow the second rule.
p89
aVThat means keep the server in your hands.
p90
aVHe allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service,
p91
aVto continue to stay on inside of Tunisia.
p92
aVSo he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post
p93
aVcritical videos against his corruption.
p94
aVThe same thing happend. He was the first
p95
aVto topple during the Arab Spring.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut those two very smart international censorship policies
p98
aVdidn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere,
p99
aVa pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials.
p100
aVBecause we have 300 million microbloggers in China.
p101
aVIt's the entire population of the United States.
p102
aVSo when these 300 million people, microbloggers,
p103
aVeven they block the tweet in our censored platform.
p104
aVBut itself \u2014 the Chinanet \u2014 but itself can create
p105
aVvery powerful energy, which has never happened
p106
aVin the Chinese history.
p107
aa(lp108
V2011, in July, two [unclear] trains crashed,
p109
aVin Wenzhou, a southern city.
p110
aVRight after the train crash,
p111
aVauthorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train.
p112
aVSo it angered the Chinese Netizens.
p113
aVThe first five days after the train crash,
p114
aVthere were 10 million criticisms of the posting
p115
aVon social media, which never happened in Chinese history.
p116
aVAnd later this year, the rail minister
p117
aVwas sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd also, recently, very funny debate between
p120
aVthe Beijing Environment Ministry
p121
aVand the American Embassy in Beijing
p122
aVbecause the Ministry blamed
p123
aVthe American Embassy for intervening in
p124
aVChinese internal politics by disclosing
p125
aVthe air quality data of Beijing.
p126
aVSo, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5.
p127
aVHe showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group.
p128
aVSo a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.
p129
aVBut that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50.
p130
aVHe says it's good. It's good to go outside.
p131
aVBut 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers
p132
aVstand firmly on the Embassy's side.
p133
aVI live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch
p134
aVthe American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhy is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship,
p137
aVso booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages.
p138
aVYou know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of
p139
aVa limitation of 140 characters.
p140
aVBut in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link.
p141
aVMaybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!"
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VBut in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters,
p146
aVmeans a paragraph, a story.
p147
aVYou can almost have all the journalistic elements there.
p148
aVFor example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare.
p149
aVIt's the same content. One, you can see exactly
p150
aVone Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.
p151
aVChinese is always cheating, right?
p152
aVSo because of this, the Chinese really regard this
p153
aVmicroblogging as a media, not only a headline to media.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd also, the clone, Sina company is
p156
aVthe guy who cloned Twitter.
p157
aVIt even has its own name, with Weibo.
p158
aV"Weibo" is the Chinese translation for "microblog".
p159
aVIt has its own innovation.
p160
aVAt the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo
p161
aVmore like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter.
p162
aVSo these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging,
p163
aVwhen it came to China in 2009,
p164
aVit immediately became a media platform itself.
p165
aVIt became the media platform of 300 million readers.
p166
aVIt became the media.
p167
aVAnything not mentioned in Weibo,
p168
aVit does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.
p169
aa(lp170
VBut also, Chinese social media is
p171
aVreally changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life.
p172
aVFor example, they give the voiceless people
p173
aVa channel to make your voice heard.
p174
aVWe had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system,
p175
aVbecause the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth:
p176
aVThe emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs.
p177
aVSo that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants,
p178
aVwant to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government,
p179
aVthey want the emperor to settle the problem.
p180
aVBut when more and more people go to Beijing,
p181
aVthey also cause the risk of a revolution.
p182
aVSo they send them back in recent years.
p183
aVAnd even some of them were put into black jails.
p184
aVBut now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition.
p185
aVPeople just use their cell phones to tweet.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo your sad stories, by some chance your story
p188
aVwill be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities.
p189
aVOne of them is Yao Chen,
p190
aVshe is the most popular microblogger in China,
p191
aVwho has about 21 million followers.
p192
aVThey're almost like a national TV station.
p193
aVIf you \u2014 so a sad story will be picked up by her.
p194
aVSo this Weibo social media, even in the censorship,
p195
aVstill gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people
p196
aVevery day chatting together, talking together.
p197
aVIt's like a big TED, right?
p198
aVBut also, it is like the first time a public sphere
p199
aVhappened in China.
p200
aVChinese people start to learn how to negotiate
p201
aVand talk to people.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping.
p204
aVIt's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo.
p205
aVFor example, you can't post the name of the president,
p206
aVHu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name,
p207
aVand until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders.
p208
aVSo, the Chinese are very good at these puns
p209
aVand alternative wording and even memes.
p210
aVThey even name themselves \u2014 you know,
p211
aVuse the name of this world-changing
p212
aVbattle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab.
p213
aVThe grass-mud horse is caoníma,
p214
aVis the phonogram for motherfucker,
p215
aVthe Netizens call themselves.
p216
aVRiver crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for
p217
aVharmonization, for censorship.
p218
aVSo that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.
p219
aVSo, when some very political, exciting moments happened,
p220
aVyou can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened.
p221
aVWeird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD
p222
aVof Chinese language, you can't understand them.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut you can't even expand more, no, because
p225
aVChinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded
p226
aVwas exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.
p227
aVThat means from the very beginning,
p228
aVWeibo has already convinced the Chinese government,
p229
aVwe will not become the stage for
p230
aVany kind of a threat to the regime.
p231
aVFor example, anything you want to post,
p232
aVlike "get together" or "meet up" or "walk,"
p233
aVit is automatically recorded and data mined
p234
aVand reported to a poll for further political analyzing.
p235
aVEven if you want to have some gathering,
p236
aVbefore you go there, the police are already waiting for you.
p237
aVWhy? Because they have the data.
p238
aVThey have everything in their hands.
p239
aVSo they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.
p240
aVSo the crackdown is very serious.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut I want you to notice a very funny thing
p243
aVduring the process of the cat-and-mouse.
p244
aVThe cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat,
p245
aVbut also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
VYou know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands,
p250
aVso even that \u2014 when the Netizens criticize the local government,
p251
aVthe local government has not any access to the data in Beijing.
p252
aVWithout bribing the central cats,
p253
aVhe can do nothing, only apologize.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo these three years, in the past three years,
p256
aVsocial movements about microblogging
p257
aVreally changed local government,
p258
aVbecame more and more transparent,
p259
aVbecause they can't access the data.
p260
aVThe server is in Beijing.
p261
aVThe story about the train crash,
p262
aVmaybe the question is not about why 10 million
p263
aVcriticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government
p264
aVallowed the five days of freedom of speech online.
p265
aVIt's never happened before.
p266
aVAnd so it's very simple, because even the top leaders
p267
aVwere fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom.
p268
aVSo they want an excuse \u2014
p269
aVpublic opinion is a very good excuse to punish him.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news,
p272
aVhe's a princeling.
p273
aVBut from February to April this year,
p274
aVWeibo really became a marketplace of rumors.
p275
aVYou can almost joke everything about these princelings,
p276
aVeverything! It's almost like you're living in the United States.
p277
aVBut if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup
p278
aVabout Beijing, you definitely will be arrested.
p279
aVSo this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo Chinese in China, censorship is normal.
p282
aVSomething you find is, freedom is weird.
p283
aVSomething will happen behind it.
p284
aVBecause he was a very popular Leftist leader,
p285
aVso the central government wanted to purge him,
p286
aVand he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people,
p287
aVwhy he is so bad.
p288
aVSo Weibo, the 300 million public sphere,
p289
aVbecame a very good, convenient tool for a political fight.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut this technology is very new,
p292
aVbut technically is very old.
p293
aVIt was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong,
p294
aVbecause he mobilized millions of Chinese people
p295
aVin the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.
p296
aVIt's very simple, because Chinese central government
p297
aVdoesn't need to even lead the public opinion.
p298
aVThey just give them a target window to not censor people.
p299
aVNot censoring in China has become a political tool.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.
p302
aVSocial media changed Chinese mindset.
p303
aVMore and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech
p304
aVand human rights as their birthright,
p305
aVnot some imported American privilege.
p306
aVBut also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere
p307
aVfor people to, it's like a training of their citizenship,
p308
aVpreparing for future democracy.
p309
aVBut it didn't change the Chinese political system,
p310
aVand also the Chinese central government utilized this
p311
aVcentralized server structure to strengthen its power
p312
aVto counter the local government and the different factions.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo, what's the future?
p315
aVAfter all, we are the mouse.
p316
aVWhatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat].
p317
aVThere is not only in China, but also in the United States
p318
aVthere are some very small, cute but bad cats.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VSOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.
p323
aVAnd also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse,
p324
aVbut sometimes we see them dating the cats.
p325
aVSo my conclusion is very simple.
p326
aVWe Chinese fight for our freedom,
p327
aVyou just watch your bad cats.
p328
aVDon't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats.
p329
aVOnly in this way, in the future,
p330
aVwe will achieve the dreams of the mouse:
p331
aVthat we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Applause)
p334
aa(lp335
VThank you.
p336
aa(lp337
