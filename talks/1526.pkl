VI thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,
p5
aVbut I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,
p6
aVso that was a bad idea. (Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation
p9
aVto present to you some of my music and some of my work
p10
aVas a composer, presumably because it appeals
p11
aVto my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)
p12
aVAnd I'm not kidding, I just think we should just
p13
aVsay that and move forward. (Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VSo, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose,
p16
aVand that is that I'm really bored with music,
p17
aVand I'm really bored with the role of the composer,
p18
aVand so I decided to put that idea, boredom,
p19
aVas the focus of my presentation to you today.
p20
aVAnd I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope
p21
aVthat I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story,
p22
aVtells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst
p23
aVfor creativity and invention, and how boredom
p24
aVactually forced me to change the fundamental question
p25
aVthat I was asking in my discipline,
p26
aVand how boredom also, in a sense,
p27
aVpushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of
p28
aVmost traditional, narrow definition of a composer.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhat I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt
p31
aVof a piece of music at the piano.
p32
aV(Music)
p33
aVOkay, I wrote that. (Laughter)
p34
aVNo, it's not \u2014 (Applause) Oh, why thank you.
p35
aVNo, no, I didn't write that.
p36
aVIn fact, that was a piece by Beethoven,
p37
aVand so I was not functioning as a composer.
p38
aVJust now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter,
p39
aVand there I am, interpreter.
p40
aVSo, an interpreter of what? Of a piece of music, right?
p41
aVBut we can ask the question, "But is it music?"
p42
aVAnd I say this rhetorically, because of course
p43
aVby just about any standard we would have to concede
p44
aVthat this is, of course, a piece of music,
p45
aVbut I put this here now because,
p46
aVjust to set it in your brains for the moment,
p47
aVbecause we're going to return to this question.
p48
aVIt's going to be a kind of a refrain
p49
aVas we go through the presentation.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo here we have this piece of music by Beethoven,
p52
aVand my problem with it is, it's boring.
p53
aVI mean, you \u2014 I'm just like, a hush, huh \u2014 It's like \u2014 (Laughter)
p54
aVIt's Beethoven, how can you say that?
p55
aVNo, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
p56
aVI had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So \u2014 (Laughter)
p57
aVI would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it,
p58
aVto transform it in some ways, to personalize it,
p59
aVso I might take the opening, like this idea \u2014
p60
aV(Music)
p61
aVand then I might substitute \u2014 (Music)
p62
aVand then I might improvise on that melody
p63
aVthat goes forward from there \u2014 (Music)
p64
aV(Music)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo that might be the kind of thing \u2014 Why thank you.
p67
aV(Applause)
p68
aVThat would be the kind of thing that I would do,
p69
aVand it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
p70
aVIn fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p71
aVit's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.
p72
aVI'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have
p73
aVto think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly
p74
aVas that Beethoven text is running in time through my head
p75
aVand I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations
p76
aVI'm going to make to it.
p77
aVSo this is an engaging enterprise for me, and
p78
aVI've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there,
p79
aVand now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree
p80
aVthat this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise. (Laughter)
p81
aVBut it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me
p82
aVfor a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it,
p83
aVI actually mean, the piano, because it becomes,
p84
aVit's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually
p85
aVpretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard,
p86
aVand if you're not doing things like listening to it
p87
aVafter you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.
p88
aVIt gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon
p89
aVI go through other instruments, they become familiar,
p90
aVand eventually I find myself designing and constructing
p91
aVmy own instrument, and I brought one with me today,
p92
aVand I thought I would play a little bit on it for you
p93
aVso you can hear what it sounds like.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Music)
p96
aa(lp97
VYou gotta have doorstops, that's important. (Laughter)
p98
aVI've got combs. They're the only combs that I own. (Music)
p99
aVThey're all mounted on my instruments. (Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
V(Music)
p102
aa(lp103
VI can actually do all sorts of things. I can play
p104
aVwith a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.
p105
aVSo we have this sound. (Music)
p106
aVAnd with a bank of live electronics,
p107
aVI can change the sounds radically. (Music)
p108
aV(Music)
p109
aVLike that, and like this. (Music)
p110
aVAnd so forth.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world
p113
aVof this instrument, which I think is quite interesting
p114
aVand it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about \u2014
p115
aVThis instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter)
p116
aVand the cool thing about it is
p117
aVI'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter)
p118
aVOkay? (Applause)
p119
aVSo in that regard, this is one of the things,
p120
aVthis is one of the privileges of being,
p121
aVand here's another role, the inventor, and by the way,
p122
aVwhen I told you that I'm the world's greatest,
p123
aVif you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism
p124
aVand now a healthy dose of egocentricism.
p125
aVI know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know. (Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VAnyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.
p128
aVI should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player,
p129
aVand it was this distinction that I was most worried about
p130
aVwhen I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.
p131
aVI'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that.
p132
aVI'm crying on the inside. There are still scars.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises
p135
aVare engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them
p136
aVto you today, they're actually solitary enterprises,
p137
aVand so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so
p138
aVI'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.
p139
aVI get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person,
p140
aVsometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people,
p141
aVand this is probably the capacity, the role creatively
p142
aVfor which I'm probably best known professionally.
p143
aVNow, some of my scores as a composer look like this,
p144
aVand others look like this,
p145
aVand some look like this,
p146
aVand I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.
p147
aVIt takes a long, long time to make these scores,
p148
aVand right now I'm working on a piece
p149
aVthat's 180 pages in length,
p150
aVand it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.
p151
aVI have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VSo this gets really boring and really tiresome for me,
p154
aVso after a while the process of notating is not only boring,
p155
aVbut I actually want the notation to be more interesting,
p156
aVand so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is an excerpt from a score called
p159
aV"The Metaphysics of Notation."
p160
aVThe full score is 72 feet wide.
p161
aVIt's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.
p162
aVLet's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see
p163
aVit's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates,
p164
aVwith straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand,
p165
aVand the 72 feet was actually split
p166
aVinto 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed
p167
aVaround the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony,
p168
aVand it appeared for one year in the museum,
p169
aVand during that year, it was experienced as visual art
p170
aVmost of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures,
p171
aVon Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time,
p172
aVvarious performers came and interpreted these strange
p173
aVand undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VNow this was a really exciting experience for me.
p176
aVIt was gratifying musically, but I think
p177
aVthe more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on
p178
aVanother role, especially given that it appeared in a museum,
p179
aVand that is as visual artist. (Laughter)
p180
aVWe're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter)
p181
aVI am multitudes. (Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VSo one of the things is that, I mean, some people
p184
aVwould say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante,"
p185
aVand maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean,
p186
aVbecause I don't have a pedigree in visual art
p187
aVand I don't have any training, but it's just something
p188
aVthat I wanted to do as an extension of my composition,
p189
aVas an extension of a kind of creative impulse.
p190
aa(lp191
VI can understand the question, though. "But is it music?"
p192
aVI mean, there's not any traditional notation.
p193
aVI can also understand that sort of implicit criticism
p194
aVin this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.
p195
aVI took the Copenhagen subway map and
p196
aVI renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations,
p197
aVand the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches,
p198
aVfollow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo this is a case of actually adapting something,
p201
aVor maybe stealing something,
p202
aVand then turning it into a musical notation.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnother adaptation would be this piece.
p205
aVI took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.
p206
aVI made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them,
p207
aVand the players follow these scores.
p208
aVThey follow the second hands, and as they pass over
p209
aVthe various symbols, the players respond musically.
p210
aVHere's another example from another piece,
p211
aVand then its realization.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo in these two capacities, I've been scavenger,
p214
aVin the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right,
p215
aVor thief maybe, and I've also been designer,
p216
aVin the case of making the wristwatches.
p217
aVAnd once again, this is, for me, interesting.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnother role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.
p220
aVSome of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements,
p221
aVand I often perform them. I want to show you a clip
p222
aVfrom a piece called "Echolalia."
p223
aVThis is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter,
p224
aVwho is an extraordinary performer.
p225
aVLet's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Music)
p228
aa(lp229
VOkay, I hear you were laughing nervously because
p230
aVyou too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp,
p231
aVthe intonation was a little questionable. (Laughter)
p232
aVLet's watch just another clip.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Music)
p235
aa(lp236
VYou can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know,
p237
aVthere were no clarinets and trumpets
p238
aVand flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has
p239
aVan even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players. (Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VThis was based on the experience of actually watching
p244
aVtwo people having a virulent argument in sign language,
p245
aVwhich produced no decibels to speak of,
p246
aVbut affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances
p249
aVand then the total absence of conventional instruments
p250
aVand this glut of conductors, people might, you know,
p251
aVwonder, yeah, "Is this music?"
p252
aa(lp253
VBut let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself,
p254
aVand that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."
p255
aVYou're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments
p256
aVin this clip. (Music)
p257
aV(Music)
p258
aa(lp259
VThis, in fact, is not the title of this piece.
p260
aVI was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting,
p261
aVI put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.
p262
aVLet's continue with that same excerpt.
p263
aV(Music)
p264
aa(lp265
VIt's better with a florist, right? (Laughter) (Music)
p266
aVOr at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips.
p267
aV(Music)
p268
aa(lp269
VSo with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role,
p270
aVand that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.
p271
aVI was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?
p272
aVOkay? But then there was this other stuff, right?
p273
aVThere was the florist, and I can understand that,
p274
aVonce again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music
p275
aVas we know it conventionally,
p276
aVbut let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.
p277
aa(lp278
VThis is going to be a piece called "Aphasia,"
p279
aVand it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound,
p280
aVand this invites yet another role, and final one
p281
aVI'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.
p282
aVAnd the score for the piece looks like this,
p283
aVand it instructs me, the performer, to make
p284
aVvarious hand gestures at very specific times
p285
aVsynchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape
p286
aVis made up exclusively of vocal samples.
p287
aVI recorded an awesome singer,
p288
aVand I took the sound of his voice in my computer,
p289
aVand I warped it in countless ways to come up with
p290
aVthe soundtrack that you're about to hear.
p291
aVAnd I'll perform just an excerpt of "Aphasia" for you here. Okay?
p292
aV(Music)
p293
aVSo that gives you a little taste of that piece. (Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VYeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff.
p296
aVIs it music? Here's how I want to conclude.
p297
aVI've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question,
p298
aVthat this is not the important question.
p299
aVThe important question is, "Is it interesting?"
p300
aVAnd I follow this question, not worrying about "Is it music?" \u2014
p301
aVnot worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making.
p302
aVI allow my creativity to push me
p303
aVin directions that are simply interesting to me,
p304
aVand I don't worry about the likeness of the result
p305
aVto some notion, some paradigm,
p306
aVof what music composition is supposed to be,
p307
aVand that has actually urged me, in a sense,
p308
aVto take on a whole bunch of different roles,
p309
aVand so what I want you to think about is,
p310
aVto what extent might you change the fundamental question
p311
aVin your discipline, and, okay,
p312
aVI'm going to put one extra little footnote in here,
p313
aVbecause, like, I realized I mentioned
p314
aVsome psychological defects earlier, and we also,
p315
aValong the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior,
p316
aVand there was some delusional behavior and things like that,
p317
aVand here I think we could say that this is an argument
p318
aVfor self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia,
p319
aVat least in the popular use of the term,
p320
aVand I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay. (Laughter)
p321
aVAnyway, despite those perils, I would urge you
p322
aVto think about the possibility that you might take on roles
p323
aVin your own work, whether they are neighboring
p324
aVor far-flung from your professional definition.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd with that, I thank you very much. (Applause)
p327
