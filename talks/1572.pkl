VSo if someone asked you
p5
aVfor the three words that would sum up
p6
aVyour reputation, what would you say?
p7
aVHow would people describe your judgment,
p8
aVyour knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
p9
aVToday I'd like to explore with you
p10
aVwhy the answer to this question
p11
aVwill become profoundly important
p12
aVin an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
p13
aa(lp14
VI'd like to start by introducing you to someone
p15
aVwhose life has been changed by a marketplace
p16
aVfueled by reputation.
p17
aVSebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host
p18
aVon Airbnb since 2008.
p19
aVI caught up with him recently, where, over the course
p20
aVof several cups of tea, he told me how
p21
aVhosting guests from all over the world
p22
aVhas enriched his life.
p23
aVMore than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century
p24
aVwatchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
p25
aVNow, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest
p26
aVhappened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,
p27
aVand she promised that she would refrain from leaving
p28
aVa bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
p29
aVAnd so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer
p32
aVmarketplace that matches people who have space to rent
p33
aVwith people who are looking for a place to stay
p34
aVin over 192 countries.
p35
aVThe places being rented out are things that you might
p36
aVexpect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,
p37
aVbut part of the magic is the unique places
p38
aVthat you can now access: treehouses, teepees,
p39
aVairplane hangars, igloos.
p40
aVIf you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road
p41
aVthat you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
p42
aVIt's a fantastic example of how technology
p43
aVis creating a market
p44
aVfor things that never had a marketplace before.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow let me show you these heat maps of Paris
p47
aVto see how insanely fast it's growing.
p48
aVThis image here is from 2008.
p49
aVThe pink dots represent host properties.
p50
aVEven four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home
p51
aVseemed like a crazy idea.
p52
aVNow the same view in 2010.
p53
aVAnd now, 2012.
p54
aVThere is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
p55
aVNow, what's happening here is people are realizing
p56
aVthe power of technology to unlock the idling capacity
p57
aVand value of all kinds of assets,
p58
aVfrom skills to spaces to material possessions,
p59
aVin ways and on a scale never possible before.
p60
aVIt's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,
p61
aVand, through it, people like Sebastian
p62
aVare becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
p63
aVThey're empowered to make money and save money
p64
aVfrom their existing assets.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut the real magic and the secret source behind
p67
aVcollaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb
p68
aVisn't the inventory or the money.
p69
aVIt's using the power of technology to build trust
p70
aVbetween strangers.
p71
aVThis side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer
p72
aVduring the London riots.
p73
aVHe woke up around 9, and he checked his email
p74
aVand he saw a bunch of messages all asking him
p75
aVif he was okay.
p76
aVFormer guests from around the world had seen that
p77
aVthe riots were happening just down the street, and wanted
p78
aVto check if he needed anything.
p79
aVSebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests
p80
aVcontacted me before my own mother rang." (Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why
p83
aVI'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,
p84
aVand why, after I finished my book, I decided
p85
aVI'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
p86
aVBecause at its core, it's about empowerment.
p87
aVIt's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,
p88
aVconnections that are enabling us to rediscover
p89
aVa humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,
p90
aVby engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,
p91
aVlike Etsy, that are built on personal relationships
p92
aVversus empty transactions.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back
p95
aVto old market principles and collaborative behaviors
p96
aVthat are hard-wired in all of us.
p97
aVThey're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant
p98
aVfor the Facebook age.
p99
aVWe're literally beginning to realize that we have wired
p100
aVour world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade
p101
aVjust about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,
p102
aVour bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,
p103
aVour gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing
p104
aVmoney from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
p105
aVWe are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making
p106
aVto coding on Skillshare,
p107
aVand we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
p108
aVNow welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption
p109
aVthat's enabling us to match wants with haves
p110
aVin more democratic ways.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, collaborative consumption is creating the start
p113
aVof a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,
p114
aVbut it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,
p115
aVwhere instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,
p116
aVpeople are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
p117
aVBut the key reason why it's taking off now so fast
p118
aVis because every new advancement of technology
p119
aVincreases the efficiency and the social glue of trust
p120
aVto make sharing easier and easier.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,
p123
aVand trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
p124
aVLet me give you an example.
p125
aVMeet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,
p126
aVthe best job title here of SuperRabbit.
p127
aVNow, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,
p128
aVas an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,
p129
aVhe struggled to find a new one during the recession.
p130
aVAnd then he happened to stumble across a post about
p131
aVTaskRabbit.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many
p134
aVgreat stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
p135
aVNow what happened was, in February 2008,
p136
aVLeah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them
p137
aVout for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them
p138
aVand he was salivating with saliva.
p139
aVThey realized they'd run out of dog food.
p140
aVKevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
p141
aVNow, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks
p142
aVstarting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of
p143
aVeBay for errands existed.
p144
aVSix months later, Leah quit her job,
p145
aVand TaskRabbit was born.
p146
aVAt the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting
p147
aVon a bigger idea she later called service networking.
p148
aVIt's essentially about how we use our online relationships
p149
aVto get things done in the real world.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource
p152
aVthe tasks that they want doing, name the price
p153
aVthey're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits
p154
aVbid to run the errand.
p155
aVYes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process
p156
aVthat's designed to find the people that would make
p157
aVgreat personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
p158
aVNow, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States
p159
aVand 5,000 more on the waiting list.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow the tasks being posted are things that you might
p162
aVexpect, like help with household chores
p163
aVor doing some supermarket runs.
p164
aVI actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand
p165
aVloads of laundry have been cleaned and folded
p166
aVthrough TaskRabbit.
p167
aVBut I love that the number one task posted,
p168
aVover a hundred times a day, is something that many of us
p169
aVhave felt the pain of doing:
p170
aVyes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)
p171
aVIt's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here
p172
aVis actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month
p173
aVrunning errands around his life.
p174
aVAnd 70 percent of this new labor force
p175
aVwere previously unemployed or underemployed.
p176
aVI think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption
p177
aVare like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,
p180
aVthat over the past 20 years, we've evolved
p181
aVfrom trusting people online to share information
p182
aVto trusting to handing over our credit card information,
p183
aVand now we're entering the third trust wave:
p184
aVconnecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds
p185
aVof people-powered marketplaces.
p186
aVI actually came across this fascinating study
p187
aVby the Pew Center this week that revealed
p188
aVthat an active Facebook user is three times as likely
p189
aVas a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
p190
aVVirtual trust will transform the way we trust one another
p191
aVface to face.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,
p194
aVcomes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need
p195
aVto address some pressing, complex questions.
p196
aVHow to ensure our digital identities reflect our
p197
aVreal world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
p198
aVHow do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
p199
aVHow do we stop people who've behaved badly
p200
aVin one community doing so under a different guise?
p201
aVIn a similar way that companies often use some kind of
p202
aVcredit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,
p203
aVor the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend
p204
aVon transactions between relative strangers
p205
aVneed some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian
p206
aVand Chris are good eggs,
p207
aVand that device is reputation.
p208
aa(lp209
VReputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
p210
aVLet's just take a look at Chris.
p211
aVYou can see that over 200 people have given him
p212
aVan average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
p213
aVThere are over 20 pages of reviews of his work
p214
aVdescribing him as super-friendly and fast,
p215
aVand he's reached level 25, the highest level,
p216
aVmaking him a SuperRabbit.
p217
aVNow \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I love that word, SuperRabbit.
p218
aVAnd interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation
p219
aVhas gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid
p220
aVand how much he can charge.
p221
aVIn other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation
p222
aVhas a real world value.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, I know what you might be thinking.
p225
aVWell, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers
p226
aVon eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
p227
aVThe difference today is that, with every trade we make,
p228
aVcomment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,
p229
aVwe leave a reputation trail
p230
aVof how well we can and can't be trusted.
p231
aVAnd it's not just the breadth but the volume
p232
aVof reputation data out there that is staggering.
p233
aVJust consider this: Five million nights have been booked
p234
aVon Airbnb in the past six months alone.
p235
aV30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.
p236
aVThis year, two billion dollars worth of loans
p237
aVwill go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
p238
aVThis adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data
p239
aVon how well we behave or misbehave.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, capturing and correlating the trails of information
p242
aVthat we leave in different places is a massive challenge,
p243
aVbut one we're being asked to figure out.
p244
aVWhat the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask
p245
aVis, shouldn't they own their reputation data?
p246
aVShouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested
p247
aVon building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him
p248
aVfrom one community to another?
p249
aVWhat I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand
p250
aVbooks on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
p251
aVIt's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
p252
aVIt was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan
p253
aVbecause my credit history didn't travel with me.
p254
aVI was essentially a ghost in the system.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow I'm not suggesting that the next stage
p257
aVof the reputation economy is about
p258
aVadding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
p259
aVPeople's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
p260
aVI also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up
p261
aVtweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
p262
aVThose guys are measuring influence, not behaviors
p263
aVthat indicate our trustworthiness.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut the most important thing that we have to keep in mind
p266
aVis that reputation is largely contextual.
p267
aVJust because Sebastian is a wonderful host
p268
aVdoes not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
p269
aVThe big challenge is figuring out what data
p270
aVmakes sense to pull, because the future's
p271
aVgoing to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,
p272
aVnot a single algorithm.
p273
aVIt's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform
p274
aVa Facebook- or Google-like search
p275
aVand see a complete picture of someone's behaviors
p276
aVin different contexts over time.
p277
aVI envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,
p278
aVwhen, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,
p279
aVyour cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,
p280
aVthe knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear],
p281
aVthey'll all live together in one place,
p282
aVand this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard
p283
aVthat will paint a picture of your reputation capital.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow this is a concept that I'm currently researching
p286
aVand writing my next book on, and currently define
p287
aVas the worth of your reputation, your intentions,
p288
aVcapabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
p289
aVThis isn't some far-off frontier.
p290
aVThere are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me
p291
aVand Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how
p292
aVyou can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, I realize that this concept may sound a little
p295
aVBig Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some
p296
aVenormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,
p297
aVbut ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,
p298
aVwe can actually control it more, and extract
p299
aVthe immense value that will flow from it.
p300
aa(lp301
VAlso, more so than our credit history,
p302
aVwe can actually shape our reputation.
p303
aVJust think of Sebastian
p304
aVand how he bought the cat to influence his.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue
p307
aVI'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,
p308
aVpeople [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,
p309
aVbut are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
p310
aVHow do we take their contributions to their jobs,
p311
aVtheir communities and their families,
p312
aVand convert that value into reputation capital?
p313
aa(lp314
VUltimately, when we get it right, reputation capital
p315
aVcould create a massive positive disruption
p316
aVin who has power, trust and influence.
p317
aVA three-digit score, your traditional credit history,
p318
aVthat only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,
p319
aVwill no longer be the determining factor
p320
aVin how much things cost, what we can access,
p321
aVand, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
p322
aVIndeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become
p323
aVmore powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
p324
aVReputation will be the currency that says
p325
aVthat you can trust me.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow the interesting thing is, reputation
p328
aVis the socioeconomic lubricant
p329
aVthat makes collaborative consumption work and scale,
p330
aVbut the sources it will be generated from,
p331
aVand its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
p332
aVLet me give you one example from the world of recruiting,
p333
aVwhere reputation data will make the résumé seem
p334
aVlike an archaic relic of the past.
p335
aa(lp336
VFour years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs
p337
aVJoel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something
p338
aVcalled Stack Overflow.
p339
aVNow, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where
p340
aVexperienced programmers can ask
p341
aVother good programmers highly detailed technical questions
p342
aVon things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
p343
aVThis site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,
p344
aVand 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
p345
aVNow users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,
p346
aVbut it's basically by convincing their peers
p347
aVthey know what they're talking about.
p348
aa(lp349
VNow a few months after this site launched, the founders
p350
aVheard about something interesting,
p351
aVand it actually didn't surprise them.
p352
aVWhat they heard was that users were putting
p353
aVtheir reputation scores on the top of their résumés,
p354
aVand that recruiters were searching the platform
p355
aVto find people with unique talents.
p356
aVNow thousands of programmers today are finding
p357
aVbetter jobs this way, because Stack Overflow
p358
aVand the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window
p359
aVinto how someone really behaves,
p360
aVand what their peers think of them.
p361
aa(lp362
VBut the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,
p363
aVI think, is incredibly exciting.
p364
aVPeople are starting to realize that the reputation
p365
aVthey generate in one place has value
p366
aVbeyond the environments from which it was built.
p367
aVYou know, it's very interesting.
p368
aVWhen you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits
p369
aVor super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,
p370
aVthey all talk about how having a high reputation
p371
aVunlocks a sense of their own power.
p372
aVOn Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,
p373
aVenabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.
p374
aVOn Airbnb, the people often become more important
p375
aVthan the spaces. On TaskRabbit,
p376
aVit gives people control of their economic activity.
p377
aa(lp378
VNow at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,
p379
aVon a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer
p380
aVin his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around
p381
aVthe world who've said something wonderful about him,
p382
aVand what that says about him as a person.
p383
aVHe's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced
p384
aVthat the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb
p385
aVwill lead him to doing something interesting
p386
aVwith the rest of his life.
p387
aa(lp388
VYou know, there are only a few windows in history
p389
aVwhere the opportunity exists to reinvent
p390
aVpart of how our socioeconomic system works.
p391
aVWe're living through one of those moments.
p392
aVI believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution
p393
aVthat will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
p394
aVIn the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit
p395
aVtransformed our consumer system, and in many ways
p396
aVcontrolled who had access to what.
p397
aVIn the 21st century, new trust networks,
p398
aVand the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent
p399
aVthe way we think about wealth, markets, power
p400
aVand personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
p401
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
