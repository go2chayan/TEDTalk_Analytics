VOnce upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
p5
aVIt was run by the great and powerful parents,
p6
aVand the people were helpless
p7
aVand hopeless naughty children.
p8
aVIf any of the more rowdier children questioned
p9
aVthe authority of the parents, they were scolded.
p10
aVIf they went exploring into the parents' rooms,
p11
aVor even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,
p12
aVand told that for their own good
p13
aVthey must never go in there again.
p14
aa(lp15
VThen one day, a man came to town
p16
aVwith boxes and boxes of secret documents
p17
aVstolen from the parents' rooms.
p18
aV"Look what they've been hiding from you," he said.
p19
aVThe children looked and were amazed.
p20
aVThere were maps and minutes from meetings
p21
aVwhere the parents were slagging each other off.
p22
aVThey behaved just like the children.
p23
aVAnd they made mistakes, too, just like the children.
p24
aVThe only difference was, their mistakes
p25
aVwere in the secret filing cabinets.
p26
aVWell, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think
p27
aVthey should be in the secret filing cabinets,
p28
aVor if they were, there ought to be a law
p29
aVto allow the children access.
p30
aVAnd so she set about to make it so.
p31
aa(lp32
VWell, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents
p33
aVthat I was interested in were located in this building,
p34
aVthe British Parliament, and the data that I wanted
p35
aVto get my hands on were the expense receipts
p36
aVof members of Parliament.
p37
aVI thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)
p38
aVIt wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,
p39
aVor anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got
p40
aVfrom this Freedom of Information request,
p41
aVyou would have thought I'd asked something like this.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo I fought for about five years doing this,
p44
aVand it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,
p45
aVnot \u2014 I didn't \u2014 Hey, look, I didn't set out, honestly,
p46
aVto revolutionize the British Parliament.
p47
aVThat was not my intention. I was just making these requests
p48
aVas part of research for my first book.
p49
aVBut it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle
p50
aVand there I was after five years fighting against Parliament
p51
aVin front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges
p52
aVwaiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.
p53
aVAnd I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful,
p54
aVbecause I'd seen the establishment. I thought,
p55
aVit always sticks together. I am out of luck.
p56
aa(lp57
VWell, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VWell, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was
p60
aVthat Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,
p61
aVand then they tried to retrospectively change the law
p62
aVso that it would no longer apply to them.
p63
aVThe transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else,
p64
aVthey tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.
p65
aVWhat they hadn't counted on was digitization,
p66
aVbecause that meant that all those paper receipts
p67
aVhad been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy
p68
aVfor somebody to just copy that entire database,
p69
aVput it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,
p70
aVwhich they did, and then they shopped that disk
p71
aVto the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,
p72
aVand then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks
p73
aVof revelations, everything from porn movies
p74
aVand bath plugs and new kitchens
p75
aVand mortgages that had never been paid off.
p76
aVThe end result was six ministers resigned,
p77
aVthe first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,
p78
aVa new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,
p79
aV120 MPs stepped down at that election,
p80
aVand so far, four MPs and two lords
p81
aVhave done jail time for fraud.
p82
aVSo, thank you. (Applause)
p83
aa(lp84
VWell, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
p85
aVIt was an example of a culture clash that's happening
p86
aVall over the world between bewigged and bestockinged
p87
aVofficials who think that they can rule over us
p88
aVwithout very much prying from the public,
p89
aVand then suddenly confronted with a public
p90
aVwho is no longer content with that arrangement,
p91
aVand not only not content with it, now, more often,
p92
aVarmed with official data itself.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo we are moving to this democratization of information,
p95
aVand I've been in this field for quite a while.
p96
aVSlightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,
p97
aVI used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,
p98
aVsee what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
p99
aVI think that was a pretty good indication
p100
aVabout my future career as an investigative journalist,
p101
aVand what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long
p102
aVis that it used to be quite a niche interest,
p103
aVand it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,
p104
aVwants to know about what people in power are doing.
p105
aVThey want a say in decisions that are made in their name
p106
aVand with their money. It's this democratization of information
p107
aVthat I think is an information enlightenment,
p108
aVand it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.
p109
aVIt's about searching for the truth,
p110
aVnot because somebody says it's true, "because I say so."
p111
aVNo, it's about trying to find the truth based on
p112
aVwhat you can see and what can be tested.
p113
aVThat, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about
p114
aVthe right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,
p115
aVor that women should be subordinate to men,
p116
aVor that the Church was the official word of God.
p117
aa(lp118
VObviously the Church weren't very happy about this,
p119
aVand they tried to suppress it,
p120
aVbut what they hadn't counted on was technology,
p121
aVand then they had the printing press, which suddenly
p122
aVenabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,
p123
aVand people would come together in coffee houses,
p124
aVdiscuss the ideas, plot revolution.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,
p127
aVso now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.
p128
aVOur printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.
p129
aVWe're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,
p130
aVand we have global decisions to make in this system,
p131
aVdecisions about climate, about finance systems,
p132
aVabout resources. And think about it \u2014
p133
aVif we want to make an important decision about buying a house,
p134
aVwe don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you,
p135
aVbut I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.
p136
aVAnd if we're thinking about a finance system,
p137
aVwe need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible
p138
aVfor one person to take in the amount, the volume
p139
aVof information, and analyze it to make good decisions.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand
p142
aVfor access to information.
p143
aVThat's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws
p144
aVcome out, so for example, on the environment,
p145
aVthere's the Aarhus Convention,
p146
aVwhich is a European directive that gives people
p147
aVa very strong right to know, so if your water company
p148
aVis dumping water into your river, sewage water
p149
aVinto your river, you have a right to know about it.
p150
aVIn the finance industry, you now have more of a right
p151
aVto know about what's going on, so we have
p152
aVdifferent anti-bribery laws, money regulations,
p153
aVincreased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.
p154
aVAnd it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,
p155
aVpay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out
p156
aVmore and more about these systems.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd they're all moving to this central system,
p159
aVthis fully connected system,
p160
aVall of them except one. Can you guess which one?
p161
aVIt's the system which underpins all these other systems.
p162
aVIt's the system by which we organize and exercise power,
p163
aVand there I'm talking about politics, because in politics,
p164
aVwe're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.
p165
aVAnd how is it possible that the volume of information
p166
aVcan be processed that needs to in this system?
p167
aVWell, it just can't. That's it.
p168
aVAnd I think this is largely what's behind the crisis
p169
aVof legitimacy in our different governments right now.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo I've told you a bit about what I did
p172
aVto try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming,
p173
aVinto the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you
p174
aVa couple of examples of what a few other people I know
p175
aVare doing.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer
p178
aVprogrammer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,
p179
aVand what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.
p180
aVIt's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you
p181
aVto make a Freedom of Information request,
p182
aVto ask your public body a question, so
p183
aVit takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you
p184
aVthat there is a lot of hassle making these requests,
p185
aVso it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,
p186
aVfor example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
p187
aVIt zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you
p188
aVwhen the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all
p189
aVthe correspondence, it posts it up there,
p190
aVand it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
p191
aVSo that's open-source and it can be used in any country
p192
aVwhere there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.
p193
aVSo there's a list there of the different countries that have it,
p194
aVand then there's a few more coming on board.
p195
aVSo if any of you out there like the sound of that
p196
aVand have a law like that in your country,
p197
aVI know that Seb would love to hear from you
p198
aVabout collaborating and getting that into your country.
p199
aa(lp200
VThis is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.
p201
aVAnd quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was
p202
aVone of the protesters who was outside of Parliament
p203
aVwhen the country's economy collapsed,
p204
aVand then she was elected on a reform mandate,
p205
aVand she's now spearheading this project.
p206
aVIt's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,
p207
aVand they've just got funding to make it an international
p208
aVmodern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws
p209
aVaround the world about freedom of expression,
p210
aVprotection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,
p211
aVsource protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.
p212
aVIt's a place where your data can be free, so when we think
p213
aVabout, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,
p214
aVwhat they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven
p215
aVwhere it can happen.
p216
aa(lp217
VIn my own field of investigative journalism, we're also
p218
aVhaving to start thinking globally, so this is a site called
p219
aVInvestigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track
p220
aVa dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,
p221
aVyou know, he's just funneling out cash from his country
p222
aVwhen he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do
p223
aVto investigate that is, you need to have access to
p224
aVall of the world's, as many as you can,
p225
aVcompanies' house registrations databases.
p226
aVSo this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those
p227
aVdatabases into one place so you can start searching for,
p228
aVyou know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.
p229
aVYou can try and find out how he's moving out assets
p230
aVfrom that country.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut again, when it comes to the decisions which are
p233
aVimpacting us the most, perhaps, the most important
p234
aVdecisions that are being made about war and so forth,
p235
aVagain we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.
p236
aVIt's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on
p237
aVillegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.
p238
aVSo when the Guardian did this investigation about
p239
aVthe Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into
p240
aVthe Department of Defense and ask for all the information.
p241
aVYou know, they're just not going to get it.
p242
aVSo this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches
p243
aVthat were written by American soldiers
p244
aVabout the Afghan War, and leaked,
p245
aVand then they're able to do this investigation.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnother rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.
p248
aVAgain, this is all based around leaks,
p249
aV251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved
p250
aVin this investigation because I got this leak
p251
aVthrough a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker
p252
aVand ended up going to work at the Guardian.
p253
aVSo I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access
p254
aVto this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.
p255
aVIt reminded me of that scene in "The Wizard of Oz."
p256
aVDo you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto
p257
aVruns across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,
p258
aVthe dog's pulling back the curtain, and \u2014
p259
aV"Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."
p260
aVIt was just like that, because what you started to see
p261
aVis that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous
p262
aVpoliticians, they were just like us.
p263
aVThey all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,
p264
aVthose cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important
p265
aVpoint for all of us to grasp, these are human beings
p266
aVjust like us. They don't have special powers.
p267
aVThey're not magic. They are not our parents.
p268
aVBeyond that, what I found most fascinating
p269
aVwas the level of endemic corruption that I saw
p270
aVacross all different countries, and particularly centered
p271
aVaround the heart of power, around public officials
p272
aVwho were embezzling the public's money
p273
aVfor their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that
p274
aVbecause of official secrecy.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be
p277
aVmore open than publishing all the material?
p278
aVBecause that is what Julian Assange did.
p279
aVHe wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it
p280
aVto be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.
p281
aVThat did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan
p282
aVbeing exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator
p283
aVwas given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners
p284
aVin that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.
p285
aVIs that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me,
p286
aVwhat it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power,
p287
aVresponsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner
p288
aVwith power. It's about sharing responsibility,
p289
aVsharing accountability. Also, the fact that
p290
aVhe threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,
p291
aVI thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency
p292
aVin ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)
p293
aa(lp294
VThe other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,
p295
aVand you must have two real qualities, I think,
p296
aVwhen you come to the table, when you're dealing
p297
aVwith power, talking about power,
p298
aVbecause of its seductive capacity.
p299
aVYou've got to have skepticism and humility.
p300
aVSkepticism, because you must always be challenging.
p301
aVI want to see why do you \u2014 you just say so? That's not good enough.
p302
aVI want to see the evidence behind why that's so.
p303
aVAnd humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.
p304
aVAnd if you don't have skepticism and humility,
p305
aVthen it's a really short journey to go from reformer
p306
aVto autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm"
p307
aVto get that message about how power corrupts people.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody
p310
aVwithin the rule of law rights to information.
p311
aVAt the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
p312
aVIn a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,
p313
aVincluding in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act
p314
aVwith no public interest test. So that means it's a crime,
p315
aVpeople are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,
p316
aVfor publishing or giving away official information.
p317
aVNow wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want
p318
aVall of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act
p319
aVwhere officials were punished if they were found
p320
aVto have suppressed or hidden information
p321
aVthat was in the public interest?
p322
aVSo that \u2014 yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)
p323
aVI would like us to work towards that.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is
p326
aVprogress on the line, but I think what we find is that
p327
aVthe closer that we get right into the heart of power,
p328
aVthe more opaque, closed it becomes.
p329
aVSo it was only just the other week that I heard London's
p330
aVMetropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why
p331
aVthe police need access to all of our communications,
p332
aVspying on us without any judicial oversight,
p333
aVand he said it was a matter of life and death.
p334
aVHe actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.
p335
aVThere was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.
p336
aVIt was just, "Because I say so.
p337
aVYou have to trust me. Take it on faith."
p338
aVWell, I'm sorry, people, but we are back
p339
aVto the pre-Enlightenment Church,
p340
aVand we need to fight against that.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo he was talking about the law in Britain which is
p343
aVthe Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
p344
aVIn America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
p345
aVYou've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.
p346
aVYou have the National Security Agency building
p347
aVthe world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal \u2014
p348
aVit's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,
p349
aVin which they're going to intercept and analyze
p350
aVcommunications, traffic and personal data
p351
aVto try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.
p352
aa(lp353
VWell, to go back to our original story, the parents
p354
aVhave panicked. They've locked all the doors.
p355
aVThey've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras.
p356
aVThey're watching all of us. They've dug a basement,
p357
aVand they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms
p358
aVand figure out which ones of us are troublesome,
p359
aVand if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.
p360
aVWell, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
p361
aVSome fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
p362
aVI think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are,
p363
aVindeed, very grim.
p364
aVBut the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal
p365
aVthan we want to acknowledge.
p366
aVEqually, it could be better than we've been led to believe,
p367
aVbut either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,
p368
aVwith all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it
p369
aVwith all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them
p370
aVand live in a world in which we can all be
p371
aVhappily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.
p372
aV(Applause)
p373
aVThank you. (Applause)
