VWhat I want to do this afternoon
p5
aVis something a little different than what's scheduled.
p6
aVForeign policy, you can figure that out
p7
aVby watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,
p8
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p9
aa(lp10
VI want to talk about young people and structure,
p11
aVyoung people and structure.
p12
aVThis was last Wednesday afternoon
p13
aVat a school in Brooklyn, New York,
p14
aVat Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.
p15
aVAnd I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.
p16
aVThey were around me in three directions.
p17
aVYou'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.
p18
aVYou'll notice that the building is rather austere.
p19
aVIt's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.
p20
aVThey still have old blackboards and whatnot.
p21
aVAnd there are about 300 kids in this school,
p22
aVand the school's been going now for four years,
p23
aVand they're about to graduate their first class.
p24
aVTwenty-two people are graduating,
p25
aVand all 22 are going to college.
p26
aVThey all come from homes where there is, for the most part,
p27
aVjust one person in the home,
p28
aVusually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it,
p29
aVand they come here for their education
p30
aVand for their structure.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow I had this picture taken, and it was put up
p33
aVon my Facebook page last week,
p34
aVand somebody wrote in,
p35
aV"Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"
p36
aVAnd then they said, "But he looks good." (Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VHe does look good, because kids need structure,
p39
aVand the trick I play in all of my school appearances
p40
aVis that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,
p41
aVI then invite them to ask questions,
p42
aVand when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up,"
p43
aVand I make them come up and stand in front of me.
p44
aVI make them stand at attention like a soldier.
p45
aVPut your arms straight down at your side,
p46
aVlook up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,
p47
aVand speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.
p48
aVNo slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aVAnd this young man, his name is \u2014 his last name Cruz \u2014
p51
aVhe loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVSo people think I'm being unkind to this kid.
p54
aVNo, we're having a little fun.
p55
aVAnd the thing about it, I've done this for years,
p56
aVthe younger they are, the more fun it is.
p57
aa(lp58
VWhen I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group,
p59
aVI have to figure out how to keep them quiet.
p60
aVYou know that they'll always start yakking.
p61
aVAnd so I play a little game with them
p62
aVbefore I make them stand at attention.
p63
aa(lp64
VI say, "Now listen. In the army,
p65
aVwhen we want you to pay attention,
p66
aVwe have a command. It's called 'at ease.'
p67
aVIt means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.
p68
aVDo you understand?"
p69
aa(lp70
V"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."
p71
aVAnd I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!"
p72
aa(lp73
V"Huh!" (Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
V"Yes, General. Yes, General."
p76
aa(lp77
VTry it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter)
p78
aVI don't think so.
p79
aa(lp80
VBut anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously
p81
aVfrom my military experience.
p82
aVBecause for the majority of my adult life,
p83
aVI worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.
p84
aVAnd we would bring them into the army,
p85
aVand the first thing we would do is to put them
p86
aVin an environment of structure, put them in ranks,
p87
aVmake them all wear the same clothes,
p88
aVcut all their hair off so they look alike,
p89
aVmake sure that they are standing in ranks.
p90
aVWe teach them how to go right face, left face,
p91
aVso they can obey instructions and know
p92
aVthe consequences of not obeying instructions.
p93
aVIt gives them structure.
p94
aVAnd then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.
p95
aVAnd they hate him.
p96
aVAnd the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,
p97
aVand telling them to do all kinds of awful things.
p98
aVBut then the most amazing thing happens over time.
p99
aVOnce that structure is developed,
p100
aVonce they understand the reason for something,
p101
aVonce they understand, "Mama ain't here, son.
p102
aVI'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.
p103
aVAnd that's just the way it is. You got that, son?
p104
aVYeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:
p105
aVyes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.
p106
aVDon't start telling me why you didn't do something.
p107
aVIt's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."
p108
aa(lp109
V"You didn't shave.""But sir \u2014"
p110
aa(lp111
V"No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning.
p112
aVI'm telling you you didn't shave."
p113
aa(lp114
V"No excuse, sir.""Attaboy, you're learning fast."
p115
aa(lp116
VBut you'd be amazed at what you can do with them
p117
aVonce you put them in that structure.
p118
aVIn 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.
p119
aVAnd you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant
p120
aVand they never forget the drill sergeant.
p121
aVThey come to respect him.
p122
aVAnd so we need more of this kind of structure and respect
p123
aVin the lives of our children.
p124
aa(lp125
VI spend a lot of time with youth groups,
p126
aVand I say to people, "When does the education process begin?"
p127
aVWe're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools.
p128
aVLet's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.
p129
aVLet's get it all online."
p130
aa(lp131
VThat isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.
p132
aVBut the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school
p133
aVwith structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhen does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?
p136
aVNo, no, it begins the first time
p137
aVa child in a mother's arms
p138
aVlooks up at the mother
p139
aVand says, "Oh, this must be my mother.
p140
aVShe's the one who feeds me.
p141
aVOh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there,
p142
aVshe takes care of me.
p143
aVIt's her language I will learn."
p144
aVAnd at that moment they shut out all the other languages
p145
aVthat they could be learning at that age,
p146
aVbut by three months, that's her.
p147
aVAnd if the person doing it, whether it's the mother
p148
aVor grandmother, whoever's doing it,
p149
aVthat is when the education process begins.
p150
aVThat's when language begins.
p151
aVThat's when love begins. That's when structure begins.
p152
aVThat's when you start to imprint on the child
p153
aVthat "you are special,
p154
aVyou are different from every other child in the world.
p155
aVAnd we're going to read to you."
p156
aVA child who has not been read to
p157
aVis in danger when that child gets to school.
p158
aVA child who doesn't know his or her colors
p159
aVor doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes,
p160
aVdoesn't know how to do those things,
p161
aVand doesn't know how to do something that
p162
aVgoes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.
p163
aVMind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying!
p164
aVThis is the way children are raised properly.
p165
aVAnd I watched my own young grandchildren now come along
p166
aVand they're, much to the distress of my children,
p167
aVthey are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.
p170
aVAnd I'm working at all the energy I have
p171
aVto sort of communicate this message that
p172
aVwe need preschool, we need Head Start,
p173
aVwe need prenatal care.
p174
aVThe education process begins even before the child is born,
p175
aVand if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.
p176
aVAnd we are having difficulties in so many of our communities
p177
aVand so many of our schools where kids are coming
p178
aVto first grade and their eyes are blazing,
p179
aVthey've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go,
p180
aVand then they realize they're not like the other first graders
p181
aVwho know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.
p182
aVAnd by the third grade, the kids who didn't have
p183
aVthat structure and minding in the beginning
p184
aVstart to realize they're behind, and what do they do?
p185
aVThey act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way
p186
aVto jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.
p187
aVIt's predictable.
p188
aVIf you're not at the right reading level at third grade,
p189
aVyou are a candidate for jail at age 18,
p190
aVand we have the highest incarceration rate
p191
aVbecause we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe last chapter in my book is called
p194
aV"The Gift of a Good Start."
p195
aVThe gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.
p196
aa(lp197
VI was privileged to have that kind of good start.
p198
aVI was not a great student.
p199
aVI was a public school kid in New York City,
p200
aVand I didn't do well at all.
p201
aVI have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript
p202
aVfrom kindergarten through college.
p203
aVI wanted it when I was writing my first book.
p204
aVI wanted to see if my memory was correct,
p205
aVand, my God, it was. (Laughter)
p206
aVStraight C everywhere.
p207
aVAnd I finally bounced through high school,
p208
aVgot into the City College of New York
p209
aVwith a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with,
p210
aVand then I started out in engineering,
p211
aVand that only lasted six months. (Laughter)
p212
aVAnd then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy.
p213
aVAnd then I found ROTC.
p214
aVI found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,
p215
aVand I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.
p216
aVAnd so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.
p217
aVAnd I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up
p218
aVand as this structure is being developed inside of you,
p219
aValways be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,
p220
aVand when you find those two things together, man, you got it.
p221
aVThat's what's going on. And that's what I found.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.
p224
aVI'd been there four and a half going on five years,
p225
aVand my grades were not doing particularly well,
p226
aVand I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.
p227
aVAnd so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC.
p228
aVLook, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."
p229
aVAnd so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades
p230
aVand roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."
p231
aVAnd they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)
p232
aVYep. (Laughter) (Applause)
p233
aVThey said, "It's good enough for government work.
p234
aVGive him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."
p235
aVSo they shipped me off to the army,
p236
aVand lo and behold, many years later,
p237
aVI'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)
p238
aVSo, I tell young people everywhere,
p239
aVit ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life
p240
aVthat determines where you end up in life,
p241
aVand you are blessed to be living in a country that,
p242
aVno matter where you start, you have opportunities
p243
aVso long as you believe in yourself,
p244
aVyou believe in the society and the country,
p245
aVand you believe that you can self-improve
p246
aVand educate yourself as you go along.
p247
aVAnd that's the key to success.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut it begins with the gift of a good start.
p250
aVIf we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids,
p251
aVif we don't invest at the earliest age,
p252
aVwe're going to be running into difficulties.
p253
aVIt's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall
p254
aVand almost 50 percent of our minority population
p255
aVliving in low-income areas,
p256
aVbecause they're not getting the gift of a good start.
p257
aa(lp258
VMy gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family,
p259
aVa good family, but having a family that said to me,
p260
aV"Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats
p261
aVin 1920 and 1924.
p262
aVWe worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day.
p263
aVWe're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose
p264
aVor get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."
p265
aVIf I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people
p266
aVthat, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out,"
p267
aVthey'd said, "We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid."
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VThey had expectations for all of the cousins
p271
aVand the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx,
p272
aVbut they had more than just expectations for us.
p273
aVThey stuck into our hearts like a dagger
p274
aVa sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."
p275
aVSometimes I would get in trouble,
p276
aVand my parents were coming home,
p277
aVand I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen,
p278
aVand I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look,
p279
aVtake the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."
p280
aVIt devastated me when my mother did that to me.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd I also had this extended network.
p283
aVChildren need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe,
p284
aVa family, a community.
p285
aVIn my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.
p286
aVI don't know how many of you are New Yorkers,
p287
aVbut there were these tenement buildings,
p288
aVand these women were always hanging out one of the windows,
p289
aVleaning on a pillow.
p290
aVThey never left. (Laughter)
p291
aVI, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets,
p292
aVand they were always there.
p293
aVThey never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter)
p294
aVThey never did anything.
p295
aVBut what they did was keep us in play.
p296
aVThey kept us in play.
p297
aVAnd they didn't care
p298
aVwhether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general,
p299
aVand they never expected any generals in the family,
p300
aVas long as you got an education and then you got a job.
p301
aa(lp302
V"Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff.
p303
aVYou get a job and get out of the house.
p304
aVWe don't have time to waste for that.
p305
aVAnd then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture
p308
aVback into our families, all families.
p309
aVAnd it is so important that all of you here today
p310
aVwho are successful people,
p311
aVand I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren,
p312
aVit's not enough. You've got to reach out and back
p313
aVand find kids like Mr. Cruz
p314
aVwho can make it if you give them the structure,
p315
aVif you reach back and help, if you mentor,
p316
aVif you invest in boys and girls clubs,
p317
aVif you work with your school system,
p318
aVmake sure it's the best school system,
p319
aVand not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem,
p320
aVnot just downtown Montessori on the West Side.
p321
aVAll of us have to have a commitment to do that.
p322
aVAnd we're not just investing in the kids.
p323
aVWe're investing in our future.
p324
aa(lp325
VWe're going to be a minority-majority country
p326
aVin one more generation.
p327
aVThose that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.
p328
aVAnd we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.
p329
aVWe have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders
p330
aVof this great country of ours,
p331
aVa country that is like no other,
p332
aVa country that amazes me every single day,
p333
aVa country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.
p334
aVThat's how the system's supposed to work.
p335
aVIt's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.
p336
aVWe touch every nation. Every nation touches us.
p337
aVWe are a nation of immigrants.
p338
aVThat's why we need sound immigration policy.
p339
aVIt's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy
p340
aVto welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation,
p341
aVor we can send back home with an education
p342
aVto help their people rise up out of poverty.
p343
aVOne of the great stories I love to tell is about my love
p344
aVof going to my hometown of New York
p345
aVand walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day
p346
aVand admiring everything and seeing all the people go by
p347
aVfrom all over the world.
p348
aVBut what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners
p349
aVand get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.
p350
aVGotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter)
p351
aVAnd no matter where I am or what I'm doing,
p352
aVI've got to do that.
p353
aVI even did it when I was Secretary of State.
p354
aVI'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria
p355
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p356
aVbe walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street
p357
aVlooking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.
p358
aVIn those days, I had five bodyguards around me
p359
aVand three New York City police cars would roll alongside
p360
aVto make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter)
p361
aVAnd I would order the hot dog from the guy,
p362
aVand he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around
p363
aVat the bodyguards and the police cars \u2014
p364
aV"I've got a green card! I've got a green card!" (Laughter)
p365
aV"It's okay, it's okay."
p366
aa(lp367
VBut now I'm alone. I'm alone.
p368
aVI've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.
p369
aVBut I gotta have my hot dog.
p370
aa(lp371
VI did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening
p372
aVdown by Columbus Circle.
p373
aVAnd the scene repeats itself so often.
p374
aVI'll go up and ask for my hot dog,
p375
aVand the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing,
p376
aVhe'll say, "I know you. I see you on television.
p377
aa(lp378
VYou're, well, you're General Powell."
p379
aa(lp380
V"Yes, yes.""Oh ... "
p381
aa(lp382
VI hand him the money.
p383
aa(lp384
V"No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid.
p385
aVAmerica has paid me. I never forget where I came from.
p386
aVBut now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."
p387
aa(lp388
VI accept the generosity, continue up the street,
p389
aVand it washes over me, my God,
p390
aVit's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.
p391
aa(lp392
VSo we are still that magnificent country,
p393
aVbut we are fueled by young people coming up
p394
aVfrom every land in the world,
p395
aVand it is our obligation as contributing citizens
p396
aVto this wonderful country of ours
p397
aVto make sure that no child gets left behind.
p398
aa(lp399
VThank you very much.
