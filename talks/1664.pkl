VIn my previous life, I was an artist.
p5
aVI still paint. I love art.
p6
aVI love the joy that color can give to our lives
p7
aVand to our communities,
p8
aVand I try to bring something of the artist in me
p9
aVin my politics,
p10
aVand I see
p11
aVpart of my job today, the reason for being here,
p12
aVnot just to campaign for my party,
p13
aVbut for politics, and the role it can play
p14
aVfor the better in our lives.
p15
aa(lp16
VFor 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.
p17
aVWe faced many challenges.
p18
aVArt was part of the answer,
p19
aVand my name, in the very beginning,
p20
aVwas linked with two things:
p21
aVdemolition of illegal constructions
p22
aVin order to get public space back,
p23
aVand use of colors in order to revive the hope
p24
aVthat had been lost in my city.
p25
aVBut this use of colors was not just an artistic act.
p26
aVRather, it was a form of political action
p27
aVin a context when the city budget I had available
p28
aVafter being elected amounted to zero comma something.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhen we painted the first building,
p31
aVby splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray
p32
aVof a facade,
p33
aVsomething unimaginable happened.
p34
aVThere was a traffic jam
p35
aVand a crowd of people gathered
p36
aVas if it were the location of some spectacular accident,
p37
aVor the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe French E.U. official in charge of the funding
p40
aVrushed to block the painting.
p41
aVHe screeched that he would block the financing.
p42
aa(lp43
V"But why?" I asked him.
p44
aa(lp45
V"Because the colors you have ordered
p46
aVdo not meet European standards," he replied.
p47
aa(lp48
V"Well," I told him,
p49
aV"the surroundings do not meet European standards,
p50
aVeven though this is not what we want,
p51
aVbut we will choose the colors ourselves,
p52
aVbecause this is exactly what we want.
p53
aVAnd if you do not let us continue with our work,
p54
aVI will hold a press conference here,
p55
aVright now, right in this road,
p56
aVand we will tell people that you look to me
p57
aVjust like the censors of the socialist realism era."
p58
aa(lp59
VThen he was kind of troubled,
p60
aVand asked me for a compromise.
p61
aVBut I told him no, I'm sorry,
p62
aVcompromise in colors is gray,
p63
aVand we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aVSo it's time for change.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe rehabilitation of public spaces
p68
aVrevived the feeling of belonging
p69
aVto a city that people lost.
p70
aVThe pride of people about their own place of living,
p71
aVand there were feelings that had been buried
p72
aVdeep for years under the fury of the illegal,
p73
aVbarbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.
p74
aVAnd when colors came out everywhere,
p75
aVa mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.
p76
aVBig noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening?
p77
aVWhat are colors doing to us?"
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd we made a poll,
p80
aVthe most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
p81
aVWe asked people, "Do you want this action,
p82
aVand to have buildings painted like that?"
p83
aVAnd then the second question was,
p84
aV"Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
p85
aVTo the first question,
p86
aV63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
p87
aVThirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
p88
aVBut to the second question, half of them that didn't like it,
p89
aVthey wanted it to continue. (Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VSo we noticed change.
p92
aVPeople started to drop less litter in the streets, for example,
p93
aVstarted to pay taxes,
p94
aVstarted to feel something they had forgotten,
p95
aVand beauty was acting as a guardsman
p96
aVwhere municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.
p97
aa(lp98
VOne day I remember walking along a street
p99
aVthat had just been colored,
p100
aVand where we were in the process of planting trees,
p101
aVwhen I saw a shopkeeper and his wife
p102
aVputting a glass facade to their shop.
p103
aVThey had thrown the old shutter
p104
aVin the garbage collection place.
p105
aa(lp106
V"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.
p107
aa(lp108
V"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.
p109
aa(lp110
V"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"
p111
aa(lp112
V"Come on, man! What policemen?
p113
aVYou can see it for yourself. There are colors,
p114
aVstreetlights, new pavement with no potholes,
p115
aVtrees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd indeed, it was beauty that was giving people
p118
aVthis feeling of being protected.
p119
aVAnd this was not a misplaced feeling.
p120
aVCrime did fall.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe freedom that was won in 1990
p123
aVbrought about a state of anarchy in the city,
p124
aVwhile the barbarism of the '90s
p125
aVbrought about a loss of hope for the city.
p126
aVThe paint on the walls did not feed children,
p127
aVnor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,
p128
aVbut it gave hope and light,
p129
aVand helped to make people see
p130
aVthere could be a different way of doing things,
p131
aVa different spirit, a different feel to our lives,
p132
aVand that if we brought the same energy and hope
p133
aVto our politics, we could build a better life
p134
aVfor each other and for our country.
p135
aVWe removed 123,000 tons of concrete
p136
aVonly from the riverbanks.
p137
aVWe demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings
p138
aVall over the city,
p139
aVup to eight stories high, the tallest of them.
p140
aVWe planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
p141
aVWe established a green tax,
p142
aVand then everybody accepted it
p143
aVand all businessmen paid it regularly.
p144
aVBy means of open competitions,
p145
aVwe managed to recruit in our administration
p146
aVmany young people,
p147
aVand we thus managed to build
p148
aVa de-politicized public institution
p149
aVwhere men and women were equally represented.
p150
aa(lp151
VInternational organizations
p152
aVhave invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years,
p153
aVnot all of it well spent.
p154
aVWhen I told the World Bank directors
p155
aVthat I wanted them to finance a project to build
p156
aVa model reception hall for citizens
p157
aVprecisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption,
p158
aVthey did not understand me.
p159
aVBut people were waiting in long queues
p160
aVunder sun and under rain
p161
aVin order to get a certificate or just a simple answer
p162
aVfrom two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.
p163
aVThey were paying in order to skip the queue,
p164
aVthe long queue.
p165
aVThe reply to their requests was met
p166
aVby a voice coming from this dark hole,
p167
aVand, on the other hand,
p168
aVa mysterious hand coming out to take their documents
p169
aVwhile searching through old documents for the bribe.
p170
aVWe could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks,
p171
aVevery week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.
p172
aa(lp173
V"I'm convinced," I told a German official
p174
aVwith the World Bank,
p175
aV"that it would be impossible for them to be bribed
p176
aVif they worked in Germany,
p177
aVin a German administration,
p178
aVjust as I am convinced that if you put German officials
p179
aVfrom the German administration in those holes,
p180
aVthey would be bribed just the same."
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VIt's not about genes.
p185
aVIt's not about some being with a high conscience
p186
aVand some others having not a conscience.
p187
aVIt's about system, it's about organization.
p188
aVIt's also about environment and respect.
p189
aa(lp190
VWe removed the kiosks.
p191
aVWe built the bright new reception hall
p192
aVthat made people, Tirana citizens,
p193
aVthink they had traveled abroad when they entered
p194
aVto make their requests.
p195
aVWe created an online system of control
p196
aVand so speeded up all the processes.
p197
aVWe put the citizen first, and not the clerks.
p198
aa(lp199
VThe corruption in the state administration
p200
aVof countries like Albania \u2014
p201
aVit's not up to me to say also like Greece \u2014
p202
aVcan be fought only by modernization.
p203
aVReinventing the government by reinventing politics itself
p204
aVis the answer, and not reinventing people
p205
aVbased on a ready-made formula
p206
aVthat the developed world often tries in vain to impose
p207
aVto people like us.
p208
aV(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VThings have come to this point
p211
aVbecause politicians in general,
p212
aVbut especially in our countries, let's face it,
p213
aVthink people are stupid.
p214
aVThey take it for granted that, come what may,
p215
aVpeople have to follow them,
p216
aVwhile politics, more and more, fails to offer answers
p217
aVfor their public concerns
p218
aVor the exigencies of the common people.
p219
aVPolitics has come to resemble
p220
aVa cynical team game played by politicians,
p221
aVwhile the public has been pushed aside
p222
aVas if sitting on the seats of a stadium
p223
aVin which passion for politics
p224
aVis gradually making room for blindness and desperation.
p225
aVSeen from those stairs, all politicians today
p226
aVseem the same,
p227
aVand politics has come to resemble
p228
aVa sport that inspires more aggressiveness
p229
aVand pessimism than social cohesion
p230
aVand the desire for civic protaganism.
p231
aa(lp232
VBarack Obama won
p233
aV\u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p234
aVbecause he mobilized people as never before
p235
aVthrough the use of social networks.
p236
aVHe did not know each and every one of them,
p237
aVbut with an admirable ingenuity,
p238
aVhe managed to transform them into activists
p239
aVby giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands
p240
aVthe arguments and the instruments that each would need
p241
aVto campaign in his name by making his own campaign.
p242
aVI tweet. I love it.
p243
aVI love it because it lets me get the message out,
p244
aVbut it also lets people get their messages to me.
p245
aVThis is politics, not from top down,
p246
aVbut from the bottom up, and sideways,
p247
aVand allowing everybody's voice to be heard
p248
aVis exactly what we need.
p249
aVPolitics is not just about leaders.
p250
aVIt's not just about politicians and laws.
p251
aVIt is about how people think,
p252
aVhow they view the world around them,
p253
aVhow they use their time and their energy.
p254
aVWhen people say all politicians are the same,
p255
aVask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush,
p256
aVif François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.
p257
aVThey are not. They are human beings with different views
p258
aVand different visions for the world.
p259
aVWhen people say nothing can change,
p260
aVjust stop and think what the world was like
p261
aV10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.
p262
aVOur world is defined by the pace of change.
p263
aVWe can all change the world.
p264
aa(lp265
VI gave you a very small example
p266
aVof how one thing, the use of color,
p267
aVcan make change happen.
p268
aVI want to make more change
p269
aVas Prime Minister of my country,
p270
aVbut every single one of you can make change happen
p271
aVif you want to.
p272
aa(lp273
VPresident Roosevelt, he said,
p274
aV"Believe you can, and you are halfway there."
p275

Rama&#39;s administration also demolished thousands of illegal buildings, removed hundreds of thousands of tons of concrete from riverbanks, and planted thousands of trees and bushes all over the city.
