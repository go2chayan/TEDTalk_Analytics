VThe most massive
p5
aVtsunami perfect storm
p6
aVis bearing down upon us.
p7
aVThis perfect storm
p8
aVis mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,
p9
aVand we are facing that reality
p10
aVwith the full belief
p11
aVthat we can solve our problems with technology,
p12
aVand that's very understandable.
p13
aVNow, this perfect storm that we are facing
p14
aVis the result of our rising population,
p15
aVrising towards 10 billion people,
p16
aVland that is turning to desert,
p17
aVand, of course, climate change.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow there's no question about it at all:
p20
aVwe will only solve the problem
p21
aVof replacing fossil fuels with technology.
p22
aVBut fossil fuels, carbon \u2014 coal and gas \u2014
p23
aVare by no means the only thing
p24
aVthat is causing climate change.
p25
aa(lp26
VDesertification
p27
aVis a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,
p28
aVand this happens only when
p29
aVwe create too much bare ground.
p30
aVThere's no other cause.
p31
aVAnd I intend to focus
p32
aVon most of the world's land that is turning to desert.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut I have for you a very simple message
p35
aVthat offers more hope than you can imagine.
p36
aVWe have environments
p37
aVwhere humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.
p38
aVOn those, it is almost impossible
p39
aVto create vast areas of bare ground.
p40
aVNo matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.
p41
aVAnd we have environments
p42
aVwhere we have months of humidity
p43
aVfollowed by months of dryness,
p44
aVand that is where desertification is occurring.
p45
aVFortunately, with space technology now,
p46
aVwe can look at it from space,
p47
aVand when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.
p48
aVGenerally, what you see in green
p49
aVis not desertifying,
p50
aVand what you see in brown is,
p51
aVand these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.
p52
aVAbout two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.
p53
aa(lp54
VI took this picture in the Tihamah Desert
p55
aVwhile 25 millimeters \u2014 that's an inch of rain \u2014 was falling.
p56
aVThink of it in terms of drums of water,
p57
aVeach containing 200 liters.
p58
aVOver 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare
p59
aVof that land that day.
p60
aVThe next day, the land looked like this.
p61
aVWhere had that water gone?
p62
aVSome of it ran off as flooding,
p63
aVbut most of the water that soaked into the soil
p64
aVsimply evaporated out again,
p65
aVexactly as it does in your garden
p66
aVif you leave the soil uncovered.
p67
aVNow, because the fate of water and carbon
p68
aVare tied to soil organic matter,
p69
aVwhen we damage soils, you give off carbon.
p70
aVCarbon goes back to the atmosphere.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow you're told over and over, repeatedly,
p73
aVthat desertification is only occurring
p74
aVin arid and semi-arid areas of the world,
p75
aVand that tall grasslands like this one
p76
aVin high rainfall are of no consequence.
p77
aVBut if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,
p78
aVyou find that most of the soil in that grassland
p79
aVthat you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,
p80
aVleading to increased runoff and evaporation.
p81
aVThat is the cancer of desertification
p82
aVthat we do not recognize till its terminal form.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow we know that desertification is caused by livestock,
p85
aVmostly cattle, sheep and goats,
p86
aVovergrazing the plants,
p87
aVleaving the soil bare and giving off methane.
p88
aVAlmost everybody knows this,
p89
aVfrom nobel laureates to golf caddies,
p90
aVor was taught it, as I was.
p91
aVNow, the environments like you see here,
p92
aVdusty environments in Africa where I grew up,
p93
aVand I loved wildlife,
p94
aVand so I grew up hating livestock
p95
aVbecause of the damage they were doing.
p96
aVAnd then my university education as an ecologist
p97
aVreinforced my beliefs.
p98
aa(lp99
VWell, I have news for you.
p100
aVWe were once just as certain
p101
aVthat the world was flat.
p102
aVWe were wrong then, and we are wrong again.
p103
aVAnd I want to invite you now
p104
aVto come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.
p105
aa(lp106
VWhen I was a young man,
p107
aVa young biologist in Africa,
p108
aVI was involved in setting aside marvelous areas
p109
aVas future national parks.
p110
aVNow no sooner \u2014 this was in the 1950s \u2014
p111
aVand no sooner did we remove the hunting,
p112
aVdrum-beating people to protect the animals,
p113
aVthan the land began to deteriorate,
p114
aVas you see in this park that we formed.
p115
aVNow, no livestock were involved,
p116
aVbut suspecting that we had too many elephants now,
p117
aVI did the research and I proved we had too many,
p118
aVand I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers
p119
aVand bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.
p120
aVNow, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,
p121
aVand it was political dynamite, frankly.
p122
aVSo our government formed a team of experts
p123
aVto evaluate my research.
p124
aVThey did. They agreed with me,
p125
aVand over the following years,
p126
aVwe shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.
p127
aVAnd it got worse, not better.
p128
aVLoving elephants as I do,
p129
aVthat was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,
p130
aVand I will carry that to my grave.
p131
aVOne good thing did come out of it.
p132
aVIt made me absolutely determined
p133
aVto devote my life to finding solutions.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhen I came to the United States, I got a shock,
p136
aVto find national parks like this one
p137
aVdesertifying as badly as anything in Africa.
p138
aVAnd there'd been no livestock on this land
p139
aVfor over 70 years.
p140
aVAnd I found that American scientists
p141
aVhad no explanation for this
p142
aVexcept that it is arid and natural.
p143
aVSo I then began looking
p144
aVat all the research plots I could
p145
aVover the whole of the Western United States
p146
aVwhere cattle had been removed
p147
aVto prove that it would stop desertification,
p148
aVbut I found the opposite,
p149
aVas we see on this research station,
p150
aVwhere this grassland that was green in 1961,
p151
aVby 2002 had changed to that situation.
p152
aVAnd the authors of the position paper on climate change
p153
aVfrom which I obtained these pictures
p154
aVattribute this change to "unknown processes."
p155
aa(lp156
VClearly, we have never understood
p157
aVwhat is causing desertification,
p158
aVwhich has destroyed many civilizations
p159
aVand now threatens us globally.
p160
aVWe have never understood it.
p161
aVTake one square meter of soil
p162
aVand make it bare like this is down here,
p163
aVand I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn
p164
aVand much hotter at midday
p165
aVthan that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,
p166
aVplant litter.
p167
aVYou have changed the microclimate.
p168
aVNow, by the time you are doing that
p169
aVand increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground
p170
aVon more than half the world's land,
p171
aVyou are changing macroclimate.
p172
aVBut we have just simply not understood
p173
aVwhy was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?
p174
aVWhy has it accelerated lately?
p175
aVWe had no understanding of that.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhat we had failed to understand
p178
aVwas that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,
p179
aVthe soil and the vegetation
p180
aVdeveloped with very large numbers of grazing animals,
p181
aVand that these grazing animals
p182
aVdeveloped with ferocious pack-hunting predators.
p183
aVNow, the main defense against pack-hunting predators
p184
aVis to get into herds,
p185
aVand the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
p186
aVNow, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,
p187
aVand they have to keep moving,
p188
aVand it was that movement
p189
aVthat prevented the overgrazing of plants,
p190
aVwhile the periodic trampling
p191
aVensured good cover of the soil,
p192
aVas we see where a herd has passed.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
p195
aVIt has just come through four months of rain,
p196
aVand it's now going into eight months of dry season.
p197
aVAnd watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.
p198
aVNow, all of that grass you see aboveground
p199
aVhas to decay biologically
p200
aVbefore the next growing season, and if it doesn't,
p201
aVthe grassland and the soil begin to die.
p202
aVNow, if it does not decay biologically,
p203
aVit shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,
p204
aVand this smothers and kills grasses,
p205
aVleading to a shift to woody vegetation
p206
aVand bare soil, releasing carbon.
p207
aVTo prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.
p208
aVBut fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,
p209
aVand worse than that,
p210
aVburning one hectare of grassland
p211
aVgives off more, and more damaging, pollutants
p212
aVthan 6,000 cars.
p213
aVAnd we are burning in Africa, every single year,
p214
aVmore than one billion hectares of grasslands,
p215
aVand almost nobody is talking about it.
p216
aVWe justify the burning, as scientists,
p217
aVbecause it does remove the dead material
p218
aVand it allows the plants to grow.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,
p221
aVwhat could we do to keep that healthy?
p222
aVAnd bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.
p223
aVOkay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more
p224
aVwithout causing desertification and climate change.
p225
aVWe cannot burn it without causing
p226
aVdesertification and climate change.
p227
aVWhat are we going to do?
p228
aVThere is only one option,
p229
aVI'll repeat to you, only one option
p230
aVleft to climatologists and scientists,
p231
aVand that is to do the unthinkable,
p232
aVand to use livestock,
p233
aVbunched and moving,
p234
aVas a proxy for former herds and predators,
p235
aVand mimic nature.
p236
aVThere is no other alternative left to mankind.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo let's do that.
p239
aVSo on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.
p240
aVWe'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,
p241
aVand we've done so, and look at that.
p242
aVAll of that grass is now covering the soil
p243
aVas dung, urine and litter or mulch,
p244
aVas every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,
p245
aVand that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,
p246
aVto store carbon, and to break down methane.
p247
aVAnd we did that,
p248
aVwithout using fire to damage the soil,
p249
aVand the plants are free to grow.
p250
aa(lp251
VWhen I first realized
p252
aVthat we had no option as scientists
p253
aVbut to use much-vilified livestock
p254
aVto address climate change and desertification,
p255
aVI was faced with a real dilemma.
p256
aVHow were we to do it?
p257
aVWe'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists
p258
aVbunching and moving their animals,
p259
aVbut they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
p260
aVThen we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,
p261
aVand that had accelerated desertification,
p262
aVas we first discovered in Africa
p263
aVand then confirmed in the United States,
p264
aVand as you see in this picture
p265
aVof land managed by the federal government.
p266
aVClearly more was needed
p267
aVthan bunching and moving the animals,
p268
aVand humans, over thousands of years,
p269
aVhad never been able to deal with nature's complexity.
p270
aVBut we biologists and ecologists
p271
aVhad never tackled anything as complex as this.
p272
aVSo rather than reinvent the wheel,
p273
aVI began studying other professions to see if anybody had.
p274
aVAnd I found there were planning techniques
p275
aVthat I could take and adapt to our biological need,
p276
aVand from those I developed what we call
p277
aVholistic management and planned grazing,
p278
aVa planning process,
p279
aVand that does address all of nature's complexity
p280
aVand our social, environmental, economic complexity.
p281
aa(lp282
VToday, we have young women like this one
p283
aVteaching villages in Africa
p284
aVhow to put their animals together into larger herds,
p285
aVplan their grazing to mimic nature,
p286
aVand where we have them hold their animals overnight \u2014
p287
aVwe run them in a predator-friendly manner,
p288
aVbecause we have a lot of lands, and so on \u2014
p289
aVand where they do this and hold them overnight
p290
aVto prepare the crop fields,
p291
aVwe are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.
p292
aa(lp293
VLet's look at some results.
p294
aVThis is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.
p295
aVIt has just come through four months of very good rains
p296
aVit got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.
p297
aVBut as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,
p298
aVhas evaporated from the soil surface.
p299
aVTheir river is dry despite the rain just having ended,
p300
aVand we have 150,000 people
p301
aVon almost permanent food aid.
p302
aVNow let's go to our land nearby on the same day,
p303
aVwith the same rainfall, and look at that.
p304
aVOur river is flowing and healthy and clean.
p305
aVIt's fine.
p306
aVThe production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,
p307
aVeverything is now more productive,
p308
aVand we have virtually no fear of dry years.
p309
aVAnd we did that by increasing the cattle and goats
p310
aV400 percent,
p311
aVplanning the grazing to mimic nature
p312
aVand integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,
p313
aVgiraffe and other animals that we have.
p314
aVBut before we began, our land looked like that.
p315
aVThis site was bare and eroding for over 30 years
p316
aVregardless of what rain we got.
p317
aVOkay? Watch the marked tree and see the change
p318
aVas we use livestock to mimic nature.
p319
aVThis was another site
p320
aVwhere it had been bare and eroding,
p321
aVand at the base of the marked small tree,
p322
aVwe had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?
p323
aVAnd again, watch the change
p324
aVjust using livestock to mimic nature.
p325
aVAnd there are fallen trees in there now,
p326
aVbecause the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.
p327
aVThis land in Mexico was in terrible condition,
p328
aVand I've had to mark the hill
p329
aVbecause the change is so profound.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VI began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s
p334
aVturn the desert that you see on the right there
p335
aVback to grassland,
p336
aVand thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land
p337
aVwith hope for the future.
p338
aVAnd look at the amazing change in this one,
p339
aVwhere that gully has completely healed
p340
aVusing nothing but livestock mimicking nature,
p341
aVand once more, we have the third generation of that family
p342
aVon that land with their flag still flying.
p343
aa(lp344
VThe vast grasslands of Patagonia
p345
aVare turning to desert as you see here.
p346
aVThe man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,
p347
aVand he has documented the steady decline of that land
p348
aVover the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.
p349
aVThey put 25,000 sheep in one flock,
p350
aVreally mimicking nature now with planned grazing,
p351
aVand they have documented a 50-percent increase
p352
aVin the production of the land in the first year.
p353
aa(lp354
VWe now have in the violent Horn of Africa
p355
aVpastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature
p356
aVand openly saying it is the only hope they have
p357
aVof saving their families and saving their culture.
p358
aVNinety-five percent of that land
p359
aVcan only feed people from animals.
p360
aa(lp361
VI remind you that I am talking about
p362
aVmost of the world's land here that controls our fate,
p363
aVincluding the most violent region of the world,
p364
aVwhere only animals can feed people
p365
aVfrom about 95 percent of the land.
p366
aVWhat we are doing globally is causing climate change
p367
aVas much as, I believe, fossil fuels,
p368
aVand maybe more than fossil fuels.
p369
aVBut worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,
p370
aVviolence, social breakdown and war,
p371
aVand as I am talking to you,
p372
aVmillions of men, women and children
p373
aVare suffering and dying.
p374
aVAnd if this continues,
p375
aVwe are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,
p376
aVeven after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.
p377
aa(lp378
VI believe I've shown you how we can work with nature
p379
aVat very low cost
p380
aVto reverse all this.
p381
aVWe are already doing so
p382
aVon about 15 million hectares
p383
aVon five continents,
p384
aVand people who understand
p385
aVfar more about carbon than I do
p386
aVcalculate that, for illustrative purposes,
p387
aVif we do what I am showing you here,
p388
aVwe can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere
p389
aVand safely store it in the grassland soils
p390
aVfor thousands of years,
p391
aVand if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands
p392
aVthat I've shown you,
p393
aVwe can take us back to pre-industrial levels,
p394
aVwhile feeding people.
p395
aVI can think of almost nothing
p396
aVthat offers more hope for our planet,
p397
aVfor your children,
p398
aVand their children, and all of humanity.

aVand I'm sure everyone here has,
p409
aVA) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.
p410
aVI'm just going to ask you one quick question.
p411
aVWhen you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,
p412
aVit's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?
p413
aVHow do you start?
p414
aa(lp415
VAllan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,
p416
aVand the only time we have ever had to provide any feed
p417
aVis during mine reclamation,
p418
aVwhere it's 100 percent bare.
p419
aVBut many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,
p420
aVwhere I offered a £5 note
p421
aVin a hundred-mile drive
p422
aVif somebody could find one grass
p423
aVin a hundred-mile drive,
p424
aVand on that, we trebled the stocking rate,
p425
aVthe number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,
p426
aVjust by the movement, mimicking nature,
p427
aVand using a sigmoid curve, that principle.
p428
aVIt's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.
p429
aa(lp430
VCA: Well, I would love to \u2014 I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.
p431
aVThe best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you
