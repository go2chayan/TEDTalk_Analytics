VI'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.
p5
aVWe're going to use an unusual combination of tools
p6
aVfrom game theory and neuroscience
p7
aVto understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics,
p10
aVused mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology,
p11
aVthat gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life
p12
aVand it predicts what people are likely to do
p13
aVand believe others will do
p14
aVin cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.
p15
aVThat's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,
p16
aVgames like hide-and-seek, and poker.
p17
aa(lp18
VHere's a simple game to get us started.
p19
aVEveryone chooses a number from zero to 100,
p20
aVwe're going to compute the average of those numbers,
p21
aVand whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.
p22
aVSo you want to be a little bit below the average number,
p23
aVbut not too far below, and everyone else wants to be
p24
aVa little bit below the average number as well.
p25
aVThink about what you might pick.
p26
aVAs you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like
p27
aVselling in the stock market during a rising market. Right?
p28
aVYou don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,
p29
aVbut you don't want to wait too late
p30
aVto when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.
p31
aVYou want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead.
p32
aVOkay, here's two theories about how people might think about this,
p33
aVand then we'll see some data.
p34
aVSome of these will sound familiar because you probably are
p35
aVthinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see.
p36
aVA lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick,
p37
aVso I think the average will be 50."
p38
aVThey're not being really strategic at all.
p39
aV"And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33." That's a start.
p40
aVOther people who are a little more sophisticated,
p41
aVusing more working memory,
p42
aVsay, "I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50,
p43
aVand so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33."
p44
aVThey're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.
p45
aVThat's better. And of course, in principle,
p46
aVyou could do three, four or more,
p47
aVbut it starts to get very difficult.
p48
aVJust like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse
p49
aVvery complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.
p50
aVThis is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way.
p51
aVIt's something that I've worked on and a few other people,
p52
aVand it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with
p53
aVsome assumptions about how many people stop at different steps
p54
aVand how the steps of thinking are affected
p55
aVby lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.
p56
aVA very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one,
p57
aVdue largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame,
p58
aVis what's called equilibrium analysis.
p59
aVSo if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,
p60
aVyou will have learned a little bit about this.
p61
aVAn equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody
p62
aVhas figured out exactly what everyone else will do.
p63
aVIt is a very useful concept, but behaviorally,
p64
aVit may not exactly explain what people do
p65
aVthe first time they play these types of economic games
p66
aVor in situations in the outside world.
p67
aVIn this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,
p68
aVwhich is everyone wants to be below everyone else,
p69
aVtherefore they'll play zero.
p70
aa(lp71
VLet's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.
p72
aVSome of the earliest ones were done in the '90s
p73
aVby me and Rosemarie Nagel and others.
p74
aVThis is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in
p75
aVto three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.
p76
aVThe contest said, send in your numbers
p77
aVand whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize.
p78
aVAnd as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.
p79
aVThere's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.
p80
aVThere is another spike visible at 22.
p81
aVAnd notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.
p82
aVThey don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.
p83
aVThere's something a little bit noisy around it.
p84
aVBut you can see those spikes, and they're there.
p85
aVThere's another group of people who seem to have
p86
aVa firm grip on equilibrium analysis,
p87
aVbecause they're picking zero or one.
p88
aVBut they lose, right?
p89
aVBecause picking a number that low is actually a bad choice
p90
aVif other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.
p91
aVSo they're smart, but poor.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VWhere are these things happening in the brain?
p96
aVOne study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.
p97
aVSo they had people play this game
p98
aVwhile they were being scanned in an fMRI,
p99
aVand two conditions: in some trials,
p100
aVthey're told you're playing another person
p101
aVwho's playing right now and we're going to match up
p102
aVyour behavior at the end and pay you if you win.
p103
aVIn the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.
p104
aVThey're just choosing randomly.
p105
aVSo what you see here is a subtraction
p106
aVof areas in which there's more brain activity
p107
aVwhen you're playing people compared to playing the computer.
p108
aVAnd you see activity in some regions we've seen today,
p109
aVmedial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here,
p110
aVventromedial prefrontal cortex,
p111
aVanterior cingulate, an area that's involved
p112
aVin lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says,"
p113
aVand also the right and left temporoparietal junction.
p114
aVAnd these are all areas which are fairly reliably known
p115
aVto be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit,
p116
aVor "mentalizing circuit."
p117
aVThat is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.
p118
aVSo these were some of the first studies to see this
p119
aVtied in to game theory.
p120
aa(lp121
VWhat happens with these one- and two-step types?
p122
aVSo we classify people by what they picked,
p123
aVand then we look at the difference between
p124
aVplaying humans versus playing computers,
p125
aVwhich brain areas are differentially active.
p126
aVOn the top you see the one-step players.
p127
aVThere's almost no difference.
p128
aVThe reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.
p129
aVThe bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.
p130
aVSo we know that those two-step players are doing something differently.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?"
p133
aVyou might be able to look at brain activity and say,
p134
aV"This person's going to be a good poker player,"
p135
aVor, "This person's socially naive,"
p136
aVand we might also be able to study things
p137
aVlike development of adolescent brains
p138
aVonce we have an idea of where this circuitry exists.
p139
aa(lp140
VOkay. Get ready.
p141
aVI'm saving you some brain activity,
p142
aVbecause you don't need to use your hair detector cells.
p143
aVYou should use those cells to think carefully about this game.
p144
aVThis is a bargaining game.
p145
aVTwo players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes
p146
aVare going to bargain over one to six dollars.
p147
aVIf they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.
p148
aVIf 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing.
p149
aVThat's kind of a mistake together.
p150
aVThe twist is that one player, on the left,
p151
aVis informed about how much on each trial there is.
p152
aVThey play lots of trials with different amounts each time.
p153
aVIn this case, they know there's four dollars.
p154
aVThe uninformed player doesn't know,
p155
aVbut they know that the informed player knows.
p156
aVSo the uninformed player's challenge is to say,
p157
aV"Is this guy really being fair
p158
aVor are they giving me a very low offer
p159
aVin order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?"
p160
aVin which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.
p161
aVSo there's some tension here between trying to get the most money
p162
aVbut trying to goad the other player into giving you more.
p163
aVAnd the way they bargain is to point on a number line
p164
aVthat goes from zero to six dollars,
p165
aVand they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets,
p166
aVand the informed player's going to get the rest.
p167
aVSo this is like a management-labor negotiation
p168
aVin which the workers don't know how much profits
p169
aVthe privately held company has, right,
p170
aVand they want to maybe hold out for more money,
p171
aVbut the company might want to create the impression
p172
aVthat there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can."
p173
aa(lp174
VFirst some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.
p175
aVWe have some other data where they play across computers.
p176
aVThat's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.
p177
aVBut a bunch of the face-to-face pairs
p178
aVagree to divide the money evenly every single time.
p179
aVBoring. It's just not interesting neurally.
p180
aVIt's good for them. They make a lot of money.
p181
aVBut we're interested in, can we say something about
p182
aVwhen disagreements occur versus don't occur?
p183
aa(lp184
VSo this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.
p185
aVSo they have a chance of \u2014 they bicker and disagree
p186
aVand end up with less money.
p187
aVThey might be eligible to be on "Real Housewives," the TV show.
p188
aVYou see on the left,
p189
aVwhen the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars,
p190
aVthey disagree about half the time,
p191
aVand when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often.
p192
aVThis turns out to be something that's predicted
p193
aVby a very complicated type of game theory
p194
aVyou should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.
p195
aVIt's a little too complicated to explain right now,
p196
aVbut the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur.
p197
aVYour intuition might tell you that too.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording.
p200
aVVery complicated. The right brain schematic
p201
aVis the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.
p202
aVRemember that we scanned both brains at the same time,
p203
aVso we can ask about time-synced activity
p204
aVin similar or different areas simultaneously,
p205
aVjust like if you wanted to study a conversation
p206
aVand you were scanning two people talking to each other
p207
aVand you'd expect common activity in language regions
p208
aVwhen they're actually kind of listening and communicating.
p209
aVSo the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,
p210
aVand the direction of the arrows flows
p211
aVfrom the region that's active first in time,
p212
aVand the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.
p213
aVSo in this case, if you look carefully,
p214
aVmost of the arrows flow from right to left.
p215
aVThat is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity
p216
aVis happening first,
p217
aVand then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.
p218
aVAnd by the way, these were trials where their deals were made.
p219
aVThis is from the first two seconds.
p220
aVWe haven't finished analyzing this data,
p221
aVso we're still peeking in, but the hope is
p222
aVthat we can say something in the first couple of seconds
p223
aVabout whether they'll make a deal or not,
p224
aVwhich could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation
p225
aVand ugly divorces and things like that.
p226
aVThose are all cases in which a lot of value is lost
p227
aVby delay and strikes.
p228
aa(lp229
VHere's the case where the disagreements occur.
p230
aVYou can see it looks different than the one before.
p231
aVThere's a lot more arrows.
p232
aVThat means that the brains are synced up
p233
aVmore closely in terms of simultaneous activity,
p234
aVand the arrows flow clearly from left to right.
p235
aVThat is, the informed brain seems to be deciding,
p236
aV"We're probably not going to make a deal here."
p237
aVAnd then later there's activity in the uninformed brain.
p238
aa(lp239
VNext I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.
p240
aVThey're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.
p241
aVYou might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.
p242
aVMaybe if you had a chimpanzee with you.
p243
aVCharles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree
p244
aVfrom chimpanzees about five million years ago.
p245
aVThey're still our closest genetic kin.
p246
aVWe share 98.8 percent of the genes.
p247
aVWe share more genes with them than zebras do with horses.
p248
aVAnd we're also their closest cousin.
p249
aVThey have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas.
p250
aVSo how humans and chimpanzees behave differently
p251
aVmight tell us a lot about brain evolution.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo this is an amazing memory test
p254
aVfrom Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute,
p255
aVwhere they've done a lot of this research.
p256
aVThis goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.
p257
aVThe chimp is going to see, watch carefully,
p258
aVthey're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure
p259
aV\u2014 that's fast, that's eight movie frames \u2014
p260
aVof numbers one, two, three, four, five.
p261
aVThen they disappear and they're replaced by squares,
p262
aVand they have to press the squares
p263
aVthat correspond to the numbers from low to high
p264
aVto get an apple reward.
p265
aVLet's see how they can do it.
p266
aVThis is a young chimp. The young ones
p267
aVare better than the old ones, just like humans.
p268
aVAnd they're highly experienced, so they've done this
p269
aVthousands and thousands of time.
p270
aVObviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVYou can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless.
p273
aVNot only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.
p274
aVRight? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?
p275
aVWrong. (Laughter)
p276
aVWe can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.
p277
aa(lp278
VOkay, so the next part of this study
p279
aVI'm going to go quickly through
p280
aVis based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa.
p281
aVHe had a bold idea that \u2014 what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.
p282
aVWe know chimps are faster and stronger.
p283
aVThey're also very obsessed with status.
p284
aVHis thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities
p285
aVand they practice them in development
p286
aVthat are really, really important to them
p287
aVto negotiate status and to win,
p288
aVwhich is something like strategic thinking during competition.
p289
aVSo we're going to check that out
p290
aVby having the chimps actually play a game
p291
aVby touching two touch screens.
p292
aVThe chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.
p293
aVThey're going to press left or right.
p294
aVOne chimp is called a matcher.
p295
aVThey win if they press left, left,
p296
aVlike a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.
p297
aVThe mismatcher wants to mismatch.
p298
aVThey want to press the opposite screen of the chimp.
p299
aVAnd the rewards are apple cube rewards.
p300
aVSo here's how game theorists look at these data.
p301
aVThis is a graph of the percentage of times
p302
aVthe matcher picked right on the x-axis,
p303
aVand the percentage of times they predicted right
p304
aVby the mismatcher on the y-axis.
p305
aVSo a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,
p306
aVone trying to match, one trying to mismatch.
p307
aVThe NE square in the middle \u2014 actually NE, CH and QRE \u2014
p308
aVthose are three different theories of Nash equilibrium, and others,
p309
aVtells you what the theory predicts,
p310
aVwhich is that they should match 50-50,
p311
aVbecause if you play left too much, for example,
p312
aVI can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right.
p313
aVAnd as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle,
p314
aVare circled around, hovering around that prediction.
p315
aa(lp316
VNow we move the payoffs.
p317
aVWe're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.
p318
aVNow they get three apple cubes.
p319
aVGame theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,
p320
aVbecause what happens is, the mismatcher will think,
p321
aVoh, this guy's going to go for the big reward,
p322
aVand so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.
p323
aVAnd as you can see, their behavior moves up
p324
aVin the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium.
p325
aVFinally, we changed the payoffs one more time.
p326
aVNow it's four apple cubes,
p327
aVand their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium.
p328
aVIt's sprinkled around, but if you average the chimps out,
p329
aVthey're really, really close, within .01.
p330
aVThey're actually closer than any species we've observed.
p331
aa(lp332
VWhat about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?
p333
aVHere's two human groups in green and blue.
p334
aVThey're closer to 50-50. They're not responding to payoffs as closely,
p335
aVand also if you study their learning in the game,
p336
aVthey aren't as sensitive to previous rewards.
p337
aVThe chimps are playing better than the humans,
p338
aVbetter in the sense of adhering to game theory.
p339
aVAnd these are two different groups of humans
p340
aVfrom Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely.
p341
aVNone of them are close to where the chimps are.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo here are some things we learned today.
p344
aVPeople seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking
p345
aVusing theory of mind.
p346
aVWe have some preliminary evidence from bargaining
p347
aVthat early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict
p348
aVwhether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money,
p349
aVand chimps are better competitors than humans,
p350
aVas judged by game theory.
p351
aVThank you.
