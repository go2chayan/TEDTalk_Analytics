VOnce upon a time
p5
aVwe lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.
p6
aVThis was called the Great Moderation,
p7
aVthe misguided belief by most economists,
p8
aVpolicymakers and central banks
p9
aVthat we have transformed into a new world
p10
aVof never-ending growth and prosperity.
p11
aVThis was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,
p12
aVby low and controlled inflation,
p13
aVby low unemployment,
p14
aVand controlled and low financial volatility.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,
p17
aVthe great crash, broke this illusion.
p18
aVA few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector
p19
aVcascaded into five trillion dollars
p20
aVof losses in world GDP
p21
aVand almost $30 trillion losses
p22
aVin the global stock market.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo the understanding of this Great Recession
p25
aVwas that this was completely surprising,
p26
aVthis came out of the blue,
p27
aVthis was like the wrath of the gods.
p28
aVThere was no responsibility.
p29
aVSo, as a reflection of this,
p30
aVwe started the Financial Crisis Observatory.
p31
aVWe had the goal to diagnose in real time
p32
aVfinancial bubbles
p33
aVand identify in advance their critical time.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhat is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?
p36
aVWe developed a theory called "dragon-kings."
p37
aVDragon-kings represent extreme events
p38
aVwhich are of a class of their own.
p39
aVThey are special. They are outliers.
p40
aVThey are generated by specific mechanisms
p41
aVthat may make them predictable,
p42
aVperhaps controllable.
p43
aa(lp44
VConsider the financial price time series,
p45
aVa given stock, your perfect stock,
p46
aVor a global index.
p47
aVYou have these up-and-downs.
p48
aVA very good measure of the risk of this financial market
p49
aVis the peaks-to-valleys that represent
p50
aVa worst case scenario
p51
aVwhen you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.
p52
aVYou can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence
p53
aVof peak-to-valleys of different sizes,
p54
aVwhich is represented in this graph.
p55
aVNow, interestingly, 99 percent
p56
aVof the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes
p57
aVcan be represented by a universal power law
p58
aVrepresented by this red line here.
p59
aVMore interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions
p60
aVwhich are above this red line,
p61
aVoccur 100 times more frequently, at least,
p62
aVthan the extrapolation would predict them to occur
p63
aVbased on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining
p64
aVpeak-to-valleys.
p65
aVThey are due to trenchant dependancies
p66
aVsuch that a loss is followed by a loss
p67
aVwhich is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.
p68
aVThese kinds of dependencies
p69
aVare largely missed by standard risk management tools,
p70
aVwhich ignore them and see lizards
p71
aVwhen they should see dragon-kings.
p72
aVThe root mechanism of a dragon-king
p73
aVis a slow maturation towards instability,
p74
aVwhich is the bubble,
p75
aVand the climax of the bubble is often the crash.
p76
aVThis is similar to the slow heating of water
p77
aVin this test tube reaching the boiling point,
p78
aVwhere the instability of the water occurs
p79
aVand you have the phase transition to vapor.
p80
aVAnd this process, which is absolutely non-linear \u2014
p81
aVcannot be predicted by standard techniques \u2014
p82
aVis the reflection of a collective emergent behavior
p83
aVwhich is fundamentally endogenous.
p84
aVSo the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis
p85
aVhas to be found in an inner instability of the system,
p86
aVand any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, some of you may have come to the mind
p89
aVthat is this not related to the black swan concept
p90
aVyou have heard about frequently?
p91
aVRemember, black swan is this rare bird
p92
aVthat you see once and suddenly shattered your belief
p93
aVthat all swans should be white,
p94
aVso it has captured the idea of unpredictability,
p95
aVunknowability, that the extreme events
p96
aVare fundamentally unknowable.
p97
aVNothing can be further
p98
aVfrom the dragon-king concept I propose,
p99
aVwhich is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events
p100
aVare actually knowable and predictable.
p101
aVSo we can be empowered and take responsibility
p102
aVand make predictions about them.
p103
aVSo let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VThere are many early warning signals
p108
aVthat are predicted by this theory.
p109
aVLet me just focus on one of them:
p110
aVthe super-exponential growth with positive feedback.
p111
aVWhat does it mean?
p112
aVImagine you have an investment
p113
aVthat returns the first year five percent,
p114
aVthe second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,
p115
aVthe next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?
p116
aVThis is a super-exponential growth.
p117
aVA standard exponential growth corresponds
p118
aVto a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent
p119
aVThe point is that, many times during bubbles,
p120
aVthere are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,
p121
aVsuch that previous growths enhance,
p122
aVpush forward, increase the next growth
p123
aVthrough this kind of super-exponential growth,
p124
aVwhich is very trenchant, not sustainable.
p125
aVAnd the key idea is that the mathematical solution
p126
aVof this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,
p127
aVwhich means that there is a critical time
p128
aVwhere the system will break, will change regime.
p129
aVIt may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.
p130
aVAnd the key idea is that the critical time,
p131
aVthe information about the critical time is contained
p132
aVin the early development of this super-exponential growth.
p133
aa(lp134
VWe have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,
p135
aVto the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements
p136
aVon the iron rocket.
p137
aVUsing acoustic emission, you know, this little noise
p138
aVthat you hear a structure emit, sing to you
p139
aVwhen they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,
p140
aVthere's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,
p141
aVthe more damage gives the more damage,
p142
aVso you can actually predict,
p143
aVwithin, of course, a probability band,
p144
aVwhen the rupture will occur.
p145
aVSo this is now so successful that it is used
p146
aVin the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.
p147
aa(lp148
VPerhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory
p149
aVapplies to biology and medicine,
p150
aVparturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.
p151
aVFrom seven months of pregnancy, a mother
p152
aVstarts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus
p153
aVthat are the sign of these maturations
p154
aVtoward the instability, giving birth to the baby,
p155
aVthe dragon-king.
p156
aVSo if you measure the precursor signal,
p157
aVyou can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems
p158
aVin advance.
p159
aVEpileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,
p160
aVand when the brain goes to a super-critical state,
p161
aVyou have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability
p162
aVand this can help the patient to deal with this illness.
p163
aVWe have applied this theory to many systems,
p164
aVlandslides, glacier collapse,
p165
aVeven to the dynamics of prediction of success:
p166
aVblockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.
p167
aVBut perhaps the most important application
p168
aVis for finance, and this theory
p169
aVilluminates, I believe, the deep reason
p170
aVfor the financial crisis that we have gone through.
p171
aVThis is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,
p172
aVstarting in 1980, with the global bubble
p173
aVcrashing in 1987,
p174
aVfollowed by many other bubbles.
p175
aVThe biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubble
p176
aVin 2000, crashing in 2000,
p177
aVthe real estate bubbles in many countries,
p178
aVfinancial derivative bubbles everywhere,
p179
aVstock market bubbles also everywhere,
p180
aVcommodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles \u2014
p181
aVbubbles, bubbles, bubbles.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe had a global bubble.
p184
aVThis is a measure of global overvaluation
p185
aVof all markets, expressing what I call
p186
aVan illusion of a perpetual money machine
p187
aVthat suddenly broke in 2007.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe problem is that we see the same process,
p190
aVin particular through quantitative easing,
p191
aVof a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays
p192
aVto tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,
p193
aVin Japan.
p194
aVThis has very important implications
p195
aVto understand the failure of quantitative easing
p196
aVas well as austerity measures
p197
aVas long as we don't attack the core,
p198
aVthe structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, these are big claims.
p201
aVWhy would you believe me?
p202
aVWell, perhaps because, in the last 15 years
p203
aVwe have come out of our ivory tower,
p204
aVand started to publish ex ante \u2014
p205
aVand I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" \u2014
p206
aVbefore the crash confirmed
p207
aVthe existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.
p208
aVThese are a few of the major bubbles
p209
aVthat we have lived through in recent history.
p210
aVAgain, many interesting stories for each of them.
p211
aVLet me tell you just one or two stories
p212
aVthat deal with massive bubbles.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe all know the Chinese miracle.
p215
aVThis is the expression of the stock market
p216
aVof a massive bubble, a factor of three,
p217
aV300 percent in just a few years.
p218
aVIn September 2007,
p219
aVI was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund
p220
aVmanagement conference,
p221
aVand I showed to the conference a prediction
p222
aVthat by the end of 2007, this bubble
p223
aVwould change regime.
p224
aVThere might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.
p225
aVNow, how do you believe the very smart,
p226
aVvery motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers
p227
aVreacted to this prediction?
p228
aVYou know, they had made billions
p229
aVjust surfing this bubble until now.
p230
aVThey told me, "Didier,
p231
aVyeah, the market might be overvalued,
p232
aVbut you forget something.
p233
aVThere is the Beijing Olympic Games coming
p234
aVin August 2008, and it's very clear that
p235
aVthe Chinese government is controlling the economy
p236
aVand doing what it takes
p237
aVto also avoid any wave and control the stock market."
p238
aa(lp239
VThree weeks after my presentation,
p240
aVthe markets lost 20 percent
p241
aVand went through a phase of volatility,
p242
aVupheaval, and a total market loss of
p243
aV70 percent until the end of the year.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo how can we be so collectively wrong
p246
aVby misreading or ignoring the science
p247
aVof the fact that when an instability has developed,
p248
aVand the system is ripe, any perturbation
p249
aVmakes it essentially impossible to control?
p250
aa(lp251
VThe Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.
p252
aVIn 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,
p253
aVa smaller one, was unsustainable,
p254
aVso we published again a prediction, in advance,
p255
aVstating that by August 2009, the market will correct,
p256
aVwill not continue on this track.
p257
aVOur critics, reading the prediction,
p258
aVsaid, "No, it's not possible.
p259
aVThe Chinese government is there.
p260
aVThey have learned their lesson. They will control.
p261
aVThey want to benefit from the growth."
p262
aVPerhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.
p263
aVSo the crisis did occur. The market corrected.
p264
aa(lp265
VThe same critics then said, "Ah, yes,
p266
aVbut you published your prediction.
p267
aVYou influenced the market.
p268
aVIt was not a prediction."
p269
aa(lp270
VMaybe I am very powerful then.
p271
aVNow, this is interesting.
p272
aVIt shows that it's essentially impossible until now
p273
aVto develop a science of economics
p274
aVbecause we are sentient beings who anticipate
p275
aVand there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo we invented a new way of doing science.
p278
aVWe created the Financial Bubble Experiment.
p279
aVThe idea is the following. We monitor the markets.
p280
aVWe identify excesses, bubbles.
p281
aVWe do our work. We write a report
p282
aVin which we put our prediction of the critical time.
p283
aVWe don't release the report. It's kept secret.
p284
aVBut with modern encrypting techniques,
p285
aVwe have a hash, we publish a public key,
p286
aVand six months later, we release the report,
p287
aVand there is authentication.
p288
aVAnd all this is done on an international archive
p289
aVso that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.
p290
aa(lp291
VLet me tease you with a very recent analysis.
p292
aV17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,
p293
aVwe identified that the U.S. stock market
p294
aVwas on an unsustainable path
p295
aVand we released this on our website on the 21st of May
p296
aVthat there will be a change of regime.
p297
aVThe next day, the market started to change regime, course.
p298
aVThis is not a crash.
p299
aVThis is just the third or fourth act
p300
aVof a massive bubble in the making.
p301
aVScaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,
p302
aVwe see the same thing.
p303
aVWherever we look, it's observable:
p304
aVin the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,
p305
aVshowing these super-exponential trajectories
p306
aVcharacterizing an unsustainable path
p307
aVand announcing a phase transition.
p308
aVThis diagram on the right
p309
aVshows a very beautiful compilation of studies
p310
aVsuggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear \u2014 possibility
p311
aVfor a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo there are bubbles everywhere.
p314
aVFrom one side, this is exciting
p315
aVfor me, as a professor who chases bubbles
p316
aVand slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.
p317
aa(lp318
VBut can we really slay the dragons?
p319
aVVery recently, with collaborators,
p320
aVwe studied a dynamical system
p321
aVwhere you see the dragon-king as these big loops
p322
aVand we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times
p323
aVthat removed, when control is on, these dragons.
p324
aa(lp325
V"Gouverner, c'est prévoir."
p326
aVGoverning is the art of planning and predicting.
p327
aVBut is it not the case that this is probably
p328
aVone of the biggest gaps of mankind,
p329
aVwhich has the responsibility to steer
p330
aVour societies and our planet toward sustainability
p331
aVin the face of growing challenges and crises?
p332
aa(lp333
VBut the dragon-king theory gives hope.
p334
aVWe learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.
p335
aVIt is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises
p336
aVso that we can be prepared, we can take measures,
p337
aVwe can take responsibility,
p338
aVand so that never again will
p339
aVextremes and crises like the Great Recession
p340
aVor the European crisis take us by surprise.
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you.
