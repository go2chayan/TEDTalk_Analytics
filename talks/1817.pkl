VThis is Charley Williams.
p5
aVHe was 94 when this photograph was taken.
p6
aVIn the 1930s, Roosevelt put
p7
aVthousands and thousands of Americans back to work
p8
aVby building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,
p9
aVbut he also did something interesting,
p10
aVwhich was to hire a few hundred writers
p11
aVto scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.
p12
aVCharley Williams, a poor sharecropper,
p13
aVwouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,
p14
aVbut Charley had actually been a slave
p15
aVuntil he was 22 years old.
p16
aVAnd the stories that were captured of his life
p17
aVmake up one of the crown jewels
p18
aVof histories, of human-lived experiences
p19
aVfilled with ex-slaves.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnna Deavere Smith famously said that
p22
aVthere's a literature inside of each of us,
p23
aVand three generations later, I was part of a project
p24
aVcalled StoryCorps,
p25
aVwhich set out to capture
p26
aVthe stories of ordinary Americans
p27
aVby setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.
p28
aVThe idea is very, very simple.
p29
aVYou go into these booths, you interview your grandmother
p30
aVor relative, you leave with a copy of the interview
p31
aVand an interview goes into the Library of Congress.
p32
aVIt's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive
p33
aVone conversation at a time.
p34
aVAnd the question is, who do you want to remember \u2014
p35
aVif you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?
p36
aVWhat's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,
p37
aVwe always actually talked about this
p38
aVas a little bit of a subversive project,
p39
aVbecause when you think about it,
p40
aVit's actually not really about the stories that are being told,
p41
aVit's about listening,
p42
aVand it's about the questions that you get to ask,
p43
aVquestions that you may not have permission to
p44
aVon any other day.
p45
aVI'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.
p46
aa(lp47
V[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments]
p48
aa(lp49
VJesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,
p50
aVbefore we had leveled off,
p51
aVour level-off point was 45,000 feet,
p52
aVso before we had leveled off,
p53
aVPedro began leaving us,
p54
aVand the beauty about it
p55
aVis that I believe that there's something after life.
p56
aVYou can see it in Pedro.
p57
aa(lp58
V[Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years]
p59
aa(lp60
VDanny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,
p61
aVI always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you,
p62
aVand I say it so often. I say it to remind you
p63
aVthat as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,
p64
aVit's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,
p65
aVand it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
V[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz]
p70
aa(lp71
VMichael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,
p72
aVand we can leave it there.
p73
aVAnd he saved up and he purchased this,
p74
aVand he proposed to my mother with this,
p75
aVand so I thought that I would give it to you
p76
aVso that he could be with us for this also.
p77
aVSo I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.
p78
aVWhere's the right finger?
p79
aVDebora Brakarz: (Crying)
p80
aVMW: Debora, will you please marry me?
p81
aVDB: Yes. Of course. I love you.
p82
aV(Kissing)
p83
aVMW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,
p84
aVin a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.
p85
aVMy grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.
p86
aVHe used to pick people up here every day.
p87
aVSo it seems right.
p88
aa(lp89
VJake Barton: So I have to say
p90
aVI did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry
p91
aVbecause they all make you cry.
p92
aVThe entire project is predicated on this act of love
p93
aVwhich is listening itself.
p94
aVAnd that motion of building an institution
p95
aVout of a moment of conversation and listening
p96
aVis actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,
p97
aVis doing with our engagements in general.
p98
aVSo we're a media design firm, and we're working
p99
aVwith a broad array of different institutions
p100
aVbuilding media installations for museums and public spaces.
p101
aa(lp102
VOur latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,
p103
aVwhich we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.
p104
aVAnd Gallery One is an interesting project
p105
aVbecause it started with this massive, $350 million expansion
p106
aVfor the Cleveland Museum of Art,
p107
aVand we actually brought in this piece
p108
aVspecifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,
p109
aVat the same time that the museum itself is growing.
p110
aa(lp111
VGlenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,
p112
aV"We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.
p113
aVVisitors are transient. We want people who live here,
p114
aVpeople who have ownership."
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd so what we're doing is making a broad array
p117
aVof different ways for people to actually engage
p118
aVwith the material inside of these galleries,
p119
aVso you can still have a traditional gallery experience,
p120
aVbut if you're interested, you can actually engage
p121
aVwith any individual artwork and see the original context
p122
aVfrom where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.
p123
aVSo, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,
p124
aVand this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.
p125
aVOr this individual piece here,
p126
aVyou can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way
p127
aVyou think about this type of a tempera painting.
p128
aVThis is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.
p129
aVThis is Rodin's bust. You get the sense
p130
aVof this incredible factory for creativity.
p131
aVAnd it makes you think about literally the hundreds
p132
aVor thousands of years of human creativity and how
p133
aVeach individual artwork stands in for part of that story.
p134
aVThis is Picasso,
p135
aVof course embodying so much of it from the 20th century.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd so our next interface, which I'll show you,
p138
aVactually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.
p139
aVIt's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse
p140
aVthe actual museum's collection using facial recognition.
p141
aVSo this person's making different faces,
p142
aVand it's actually drawing forth different objects
p143
aVfrom the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.
p144
aVAnd so you can imagine that, as people are performing
p145
aVinside of the museum itself, you get this sense
p146
aVof this emotional connection,
p147
aVthis way in which our face connects with the thousands
p148
aVand tens of thousands of years.
p149
aVThis is an interface that actually allows you to draw
p150
aVand then draws forth objects using those same shapes.
p151
aVSo more and more we're trying to find ways
p152
aVfor people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,
p153
aVto be creative even as they're looking
p154
aVat other people's creativity and understanding them.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo in this wall, the collections wall,
p157
aVyou can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,
p158
aVand you can actually author your own
p159
aVindividual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,
p160
aVand someone can take a tour with the museum director
p161
aVor a tour with their little cousin.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut all the while that we've been working
p164
aVon this engagement for Cleveland,
p165
aVwe've also been working in the background
p166
aVon really our largest engagement to date,
p167
aVand that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo we started in 2006
p170
aVas part of a team with Thinc Design
p171
aVto create the original master plan for the museum,
p172
aVand then we've done all the media design
p173
aVboth for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.
p174
aVSo the memorial opened in 2011,
p175
aVand the museum's going to open next year in 2014.
p176
aVAnd you can see from these images,
p177
aVthe site is so raw and almost archaeological.
p178
aVAnd of course the event itself is so recent,
p179
aVsomewhere between history and current events,
p180
aVit was a huge challenge to imagine
p181
aVhow do you actually live up to a space like this,
p182
aVan event like this, to actually tell that story.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd so what we started with
p185
aVwas really a new way of thinking about building an institution,
p186
aVthrough a project called Make History,
p187
aVwhich we launched in 2009.
p188
aVSo it's estimated that a third of the world
p189
aVwatched 9/11 live,
p190
aVand a third of the world
p191
aVheard about it within 24 hours,
p192
aVmaking it really by nature of when it happened,
p193
aVthis unprecedented moment of global awareness.
p194
aVAnd so we launched this to capture the stories
p195
aVfrom all around the world,
p196
aVthrough video, through photos,
p197
aVthrough written history,
p198
aVand so people's experiences on that day,
p199
aVwhich was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution
p200
aVto make its first move this open platform.
p201
aVBut that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,
p202
aVreally the simplest we've ever made,
p203
aVwhere you locate yourself on a map.
p204
aVIt's in six languages, and you can tell your own story
p205
aVabout what happened to you on that day.
p206
aVAnd when we started seeing the incredible images
p207
aVand stories that came forth
p208
aVfrom all around the world \u2014
p209
aVthis is obviously part of the landing gear \u2014
p210
aVwe really started to understand
p211
aVthat there was this amazing symmetry
p212
aVbetween the event itself,
p213
aVbetween the way that people were telling the stories of the event,
p214
aVand how we ourselves needed to tell that story.
p215
aa(lp216
VThis image in particular really captured
p217
aVour attention at the time,
p218
aVbecause it so much sums up that event.
p219
aVThis is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
p220
aVThere's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,
p221
aVand so the firefighters themselves are running
p222
aVa mile and a half to the site itself
p223
aVwith upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.
p224
aVAnd we got this amazing email that said,
p225
aV"While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,
p226
aVI unexpectedly found a photo of my son.
p227
aVIt was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,"
p228
aVand he was writing because he said,
p229
aV"I'd like to personally thank the photographer
p230
aVfor posting the photo,
p231
aVas it meant more than words can describe to me
p232
aVto have access to what is probably
p233
aVthe last photo ever taken of my son."
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd it really made us recognize
p236
aVwhat this institution needed to be
p237
aVin order to actually tell that story.
p238
aVWe can't have just a historian or a curator narrating
p239
aVobjectively in the third person about an event like that,
p240
aVwhen you have the witnesses to history
p241
aVwho are going to make their way
p242
aVthrough the actual museum itself.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd so we started imagining the museum,
p245
aValong with the creative team at the museum and the curators,
p246
aVthinking about how the first voice that you would hear
p247
aVinside the museum would actually be of other visitors.
p248
aVAnd so we created this idea of an opening gallery
p249
aVcalled We Remember.
p250
aVAnd I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,
p251
aVbut you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter
p252
aVinto that moment in time
p253
aVand be transported back in history.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii. Voice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt.
p256
aa(lp257
VVoice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris. Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley.
p258
aa(lp259
VVoice 5: I was in Times Square. Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Multiple voices)
p262
aa(lp263
VVoice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night.
p264
aa(lp265
VVoice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning.
p266
aa(lp267
VVoice 9: We were actually in a meeting
p268
aVwhen someone barged in and said,
p269
aV"Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center."
p270
aa(lp271
VVoice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio.
p272
aa(lp273
VVoice 11: When I heard it over the radio \u2014
p274
aa(lp275
VVoice 12: Heard it on the radio.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Multiple voices)
p278
aa(lp279
VVoice 13: I got a call from my father. Voice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.
p280
aVMy business partner told me to turn on the television.
p281
aa(lp282
VVoice 15: So I switched on the television.
p283
aa(lp284
VVoice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.
p285
aa(lp286
VVoice 17: The Twin Towers. Voice 18: The Twin Towers.
p287
aa(lp288
VJB: And you move from there
p289
aVinto that open, cavernous space.
p290
aVThis is the so-called slurry wall.
p291
aVIt's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center
p292
aVthat withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River
p293
aVfor a full year after the event itself.
p294
aVAnd so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,
p295
aVof presence of that moment
p296
aVinto the actual exhibition itself.
p297
aVAnd we tell the stories of being inside the towers
p298
aVthrough that same audio collage,
p299
aVso you're hearing people literally talking about
p300
aVseeing the planes as they make their way into the building,
p301
aVor making their way down the stairwells.
p302
aVAnd as you make your way into the exhibition
p303
aVwhere it talks about the recovery,
p304
aVwe actually project directly onto these moments
p305
aVof twisted steel all of the experiences from people
p306
aVwho literally excavated on top of the pile itself.
p307
aVAnd so you can hear oral histories \u2014
p308
aVso people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades
p309
aVas you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences
p310
aVfrom that moment.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd as you leave that storytelling moment
p313
aVunderstanding about 9/11,
p314
aVwe then turn the museum back into a moment of listening
p315
aVand actually talk to the individual visitors
p316
aVand ask them their own experiences about 9/11.
p317
aVAnd we ask them questions that are actually
p318
aVnot really answerable, the types of questions
p319
aVthat 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.
p320
aVAnd so these are questions like,
p321
aV"How can a democracy balance freedom and security?"
p322
aV"How could 9/11 have happened?"
p323
aV"And how did the world change after 9/11?"
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd so these oral histories,
p326
aVwhich we've actually been capturing already for years,
p327
aVare then mixed together with interviews
p328
aVthat we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,
p329
aVBill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,
p330
aVand you mix together these different players
p331
aVand these different experiences,
p332
aVthese different reflection points about 9/11.
p333
aVAnd suddenly the institution, once again,
p334
aVturns into a listening experience.
p335
aVSo I'll play you just a short excerpt
p336
aVof a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,
p337
aVbut you really get a sense
p338
aVof the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.
p341
aa(lp342
VVoice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.
p343
aa(lp344
VVoice 3: And I knew when I saw that,
p345
aVpeople who were there that day who immediately
p346
aVwent to help people known and unknown to them
p347
aVwas something that would pull us through.
p348
aa(lp349
VVoice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion
p350
aVthat came from our country was something really
p351
aVthat will forever, ever stay with me.
p352
aa(lp353
VVoice 5: Still today I pray and think about those
p354
aVwho lost their lives,
p355
aVand those who gave their lives to help others,
p356
aVbut I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,
p357
aVthe love, the compassIon, the strength,
p358
aVand I watched a nation come together
p359
aVin the middle of a terrible tragedy.
p360
aa(lp361
VJB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,
p362
aVreflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,
p363
aVthey then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,
p364
aVbecause they've gone back up to grade,
p365
aVand we actually got involved in the memorial
p366
aVafter we'd done the museum for a few years.
p367
aVThe original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,
p368
aVhad this image in his mind of all the names appearing
p369
aVundifferentiated, almost random,
p370
aVreally a poetic reflection on top of the nature
p371
aVof a terrorism event itself,
p372
aVbut it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,
p373
aVcertainly for the first responders,
p374
aVand there was a negotiation that went forth
p375
aVand a solution was found
p376
aVto actually create not an order in terms of chronology,
p377
aVor in terms of alphabetical,
p378
aVbut through what's called meaningful adjacency.
p379
aVSo these are groupings of the names themselves
p380
aVwhich appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,
p381
aVand we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm
p382
aVto take massive amounts of data
p383
aVto actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.
p384
aVSo this is an image of the actual algorithm itself
p385
aVwith the names scrambled for privacy,
p386
aVbut you can see that these blocks of color
p387
aVare actually the four different flights,
p388
aVthe two different towers, the first responders,
p389
aVand you can actually see within that different floors,
p390
aVand then the green lines are the interpersonal connections
p391
aVthat were requested by the families themselves.
p392
aVAnd so when you go to the memorial,
p393
aVyou can actually see the overarching organization
p394
aVinside of the individual pools themselves.
p395
aVYou can see the way that the geography of the event
p396
aVis reflected inside of the memorial,
p397
aVand you can search for an individual name,
p398
aVor in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,
p399
aVand see the way in which all of those names,
p400
aVthose hundreds of names, are actually organized
p401
aVonto the memorial itself,
p402
aVand use that to navigate the memorial.
p403
aVAnd more importantly, when you're actually at the site
p404
aVof the memorial, you can see those connections.
p405
aVYou can see the relationships between the different names themselves.
p406
aVSo suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous
p407
aVgroup of names springs into reality as an individual life.
p408
aVIn this case, Harry Ramos,
p409
aVwho was the head trader at an investment bank,
p410
aVwho stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.
p411
aVAnd Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,
p412
aV"I'm not going to leave you."
p413
aVAnd Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other.
p414
aa(lp415
VThree generations ago, we had to actually get people
p416
aVto go out and capture the stories for common people.
p417
aVToday, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories
p418
aVfor all of us that are being captured for future generations.
p419
aVAnd this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.
p420
aa(lp421
VThank you very much.
