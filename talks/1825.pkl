VDemocracy is in trouble, no question about that,
p5
aVand it comes in part from a deep dilemma
p6
aVin which it is embedded.
p7
aVIt's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions
p8
aVwe face that have to do with global pandemics,
p9
aVa cross-border problem;
p10
aVwith HIV, a transnational problem;
p11
aVwith markets and immigration,
p12
aVsomething that goes beyond national borders;
p13
aVwith terrorism, with war,
p14
aVall now cross-border problems.
p15
aa(lp16
VIn fact, we live in a 21st-century world
p17
aVof interdependence,
p18
aVand brutal interdependent problems,
p19
aVand when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,
p20
aVwe are faced with political institutions
p21
aVdesigned 400 years ago,
p22
aVautonomous, sovereign nation-states
p23
aVwith jurisdictions and territories
p24
aVseparate from one another,
p25
aVeach claiming to be able to solve the problem
p26
aVof its own people.
p27
aVTwenty-first-century, transnational world
p28
aVof problems and challenges,
p29
aV17th-century world of political institutions.
p30
aVIn that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.
p31
aVAnd like many others, I've been thinking about
p32
aVwhat can one do about this, this asymmetry
p33
aVbetween 21st-century challenges
p34
aVand archaic and increasingly dysfunctional
p35
aVpolitical institutions like nation-states.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd my suggestion is
p38
aVthat we change the subject,
p39
aVthat we stop talking about nations,
p40
aVabout bordered states,
p41
aVand we start talking about cities.
p42
aVBecause I think you will find, when we talk about cities,
p43
aVwe are talking about the political institutions
p44
aVin which civilization and culture were born.
p45
aVWe are talking about the cradle of democracy.
p46
aa(lp47
VWe are talking about the venues in which
p48
aVthose public spaces where we come together
p49
aVto create democracy, and at the same time
p50
aVprotest those who would take our freedom, take place.
p51
aVThink of some great names:
p52
aVthe Place de la Bastille,
p53
aVZuccotti Park,
p54
aVTahrir Square,
p55
aVTaksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,
p56
aVor, yes,
p57
aVTiananmen Square in Beijing.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Applause)
p60
aa(lp61
VThose are the public spaces
p62
aVwhere we announce ourselves as citizens,
p63
aVas participants, as people with the right
p64
aVto write our own narratives.
p65
aVCities are not only the oldest of institutions,
p66
aVthey're the most enduring.
p67
aVIf you think about it,
p68
aVConstantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.
p69
aVAlexandria, much older than Egypt.
p70
aVRome, far older than Italy.
p71
aVCities endure the ages.
p72
aVThey are the places where we are born,
p73
aVgrow up, are educated, work, marry,
p74
aVpray, play, get old, and in time, die.
p75
aVThey are home.
p76
aVVery different than nation-states,
p77
aVwhich are abstractions.
p78
aVWe pay taxes, we vote occasionally,
p79
aVwe watch the men and women we choose rule
p80
aVrule more or less without us.
p81
aVNot so in those homes known as our towns
p82
aVand cities where we live.
p83
aVMoreover, today, more than half of the world's population
p84
aVlive in cities.
p85
aVIn the developed world, it's about 78 percent.
p86
aVMore than three out of four people
p87
aVlive in urban institutions, urban places,
p88
aVin cities today.
p89
aVSo cities are where the action is.
p90
aVCities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,
p91
aVman is a political animal.
p92
aVI say we are an urban animal.
p93
aVWe are an urban species, at home in our cities.
p94
aVSo to come back to the dilemma,
p95
aVif the dilemma is we have old-fashioned
p96
aVpolitical nation-states unable to govern the world,
p97
aVrespond to the global challenges that we face
p98
aVlike climate change,
p99
aVthen maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,
p100
aVfor mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent
p101
aVto engage in global governance.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhen I say if mayors ruled the world,
p104
aVwhen I first came up with that phrase,
p105
aVit occurred to me that actually, they already do.
p106
aVThere are scores of international, inter-city,
p107
aVcross-border institutions, networks of cities
p108
aVin which cities are already, quite quietly,
p109
aVbelow the horizon, working together
p110
aVto deal with climate change, to deal with security,
p111
aVto deal with immigration,
p112
aVto deal with all of those tough,
p113
aVinterdependent problems that we face.
p114
aVThey have strange names:
p115
aVUCLG,
p116
aVUnited Cities and Local Governments;
p117
aVICLEI,
p118
aVthe International Council for Local Environmental Issues.
p119
aVAnd the list goes on:
p120
aVCitynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization
p121
aVout of Barcelona that is using the web
p122
aVto share best practices among countries.
p123
aVAnd then all the things we know a little better,
p124
aVthe U.S. Conference of Mayors,
p125
aVthe Mexican Conference of Mayors,
p126
aVthe European Conference of Mayors.
p127
aVMayors are where this is happening.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd so the question is,
p130
aVhow can we create a world
p131
aVin which mayors and the citizens they represent
p132
aVplay a more prominent role?
p133
aVWell, to understand that,
p134
aVwe need to understand why cities are special,
p135
aVwhy mayors are so different
p136
aVthan prime ministers and presidents,
p137
aVbecause my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister
p138
aVare at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.
p139
aVTo be a prime minister or a president,
p140
aVyou have to have an ideology,
p141
aVyou have to have a meta-narrative,
p142
aVyou have to have a theory of how things work,
p143
aVyou have to belong to a party.
p144
aVIndependents, on the whole,
p145
aVdon't get elected to office.
p146
aVBut mayors are just the opposite.
p147
aVMayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.
p148
aVTheir job is to get things done, and if they don't,
p149
aVthey're out of a job.
p150
aVMayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,
p151
aVwe could never get away here in Philadelphia
p152
aVwith the stuff that goes on in Washington,
p153
aVthe paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.
p154
aVWhy? Because potholes have to get filled,
p155
aVbecause the trains have to run,
p156
aVbecause kids have to be able to get to school.
p157
aVAnd that's what we have to do,
p158
aVand to do that is about pragmatism
p159
aVin that deep, American sense,
p160
aVreaching outcomes.
p161
aVWashington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,
p162
aVare anything but pragmatic,
p163
aVbut real city mayors have to be pragmatists.
p164
aVThey have to get things done,
p165
aVthey have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside
p166
aVand draw their cities together.
p167
aVWe saw this a couple of decades ago
p168
aVwhen Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem
p169
aVin the '80s and the '90s,
p170
aVwas besieged one day in his office
p171
aVby religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,
p172
aVChristian prelates, rabbis, imams.
p173
aVThey were arguing with one another
p174
aVabout access to the holy sites.
p175
aVAnd the squabble went on and on,
p176
aVand Kollek listened and listened,
p177
aVand he finally said, "Gentlemen,
p178
aVspare me your sermons,
p179
aVand I will fix your sewers."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VThat's what mayors do.
p184
aVThey fix sewers, they get the trains running.
p185
aVThere isn't a left or a right way of doing.
p186
aVBoris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.
p187
aVStrange term, but in some ways, he is.
p188
aVHe's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.
p189
aVHe rides to work on a bike,
p190
aVbut at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.
p191
aVBloomberg in New York was a Democrat,
p192
aVthen he was a Republican,
p193
aVand finally he was an Independent, and said
p194
aVthe party label just gets in the way.
p195
aVLuzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,
p196
aVthough he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,
p197
aVin fact refused to be defined by the party
p198
aVand finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,
p199
aVnot under Gorbachev, but under Putin,
p200
aVwho wanted a more faithful party follower.
p201
aVSo mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.
p202
aVThey get things done.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut the second thing about mayors
p205
aVis they are also what I like to call homeboys,
p206
aVor to include the women mayors, homies.
p207
aVThey're from the neighborhood.
p208
aVThey're part of the neighborhood. They're known.
p209
aVEd Koch used to wander around New York City
p210
aVsaying, "How am I doing?"
p211
aVImagine David Cameron
p212
aVwandering around the United Kingdom
p213
aVasking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.
p214
aVOr Putin. Or any national leader.
p215
aVHe could ask that because he knew New Yorkers
p216
aVand they knew him.
p217
aVMayors are usually from the places they govern.
p218
aVIt's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.
p219
aVYou can run for the Senate out of a different state,
p220
aVbut it's hard to do that as a mayor.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd as a result, mayors and city councillors
p223
aVand local authorities
p224
aVhave a much higher trust level,
p225
aVand this is the third feature about mayors,
p226
aVthan national governing officials.
p227
aVIn the United States, we know the pathetic figures:
p228
aV18 percent of Americans approve of Congress
p229
aVand what they do.
p230
aVAnd even with a relatively popular president like Obama,
p231
aVthe figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,
p232
aVsometimes 50 percent at best.
p233
aVThe Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.
p234
aVBut when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor,
p235
aVdo you trust your mayor?"
p236
aVthe rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,
p237
aVbecause they're from the neighborhood,
p238
aVbecause the people they work with are their neighbors,
p239
aVbecause, like Mayor Booker in Newark,
p240
aVa mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work
p241
aVand go in and pull people out of a burning building \u2014
p242
aVthat happened to Mayor Booker \u2014
p243
aVor intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work
p244
aVbecause he sees it.
p245
aVNo head of state would be permitted
p246
aVby their security details to do it,
p247
aVnor be in a position to do it.
p248
aa(lp249
VThat's the difference, and the difference
p250
aVhas to do with the character of cities themselves,
p251
aVbecause cities are profoundly multicultural,
p252
aVopen, participatory, democratic,
p253
aVable to work with one another.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhen states face each other,
p256
aVChina and the U.S., they face each other like this.
p257
aVWhen cities interact, they interact like this.
p258
aVChina and the U.S., despite the recent
p259
aVmeta-meeting in California,
p260
aVare locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry
p261
aVfor number one.
p262
aVWe heard more about who will be number one.
p263
aVCities don't worry about number one.
p264
aVThey have to work together, and they do work together.
p265
aVThey work together in climate change, for example.
p266
aVOrganizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,
p267
aVhave been working together
p268
aVmany, many years before Copenhagen.
p269
aVIn Copenhagen, four or five years ago,
p270
aV184 nations came together to explain to one another
p271
aVwhy their sovereignty didn't permit them
p272
aVto deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,
p273
aVbut the mayor of Copenhagen had invited
p274
aV200 mayors to attend.
p275
aVThey came, they stayed, and they found ways
p276
aVand are still finding ways to work together,
p277
aVcity-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.
p278
aVEighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,
p279
aVwhich means cities are in a position
p280
aVto solve the carbon problem, or most of it,
p281
aVwhether or not the states of which they are a part
p282
aVmake agreements with one another.
p283
aVAnd they are doing it.
p284
aVLos Angeles cleaned up its port,
p285
aVwhich was 40 percent of carbon emissions,
p286
aVand as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.
p287
aVNew York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,
p288
aVmake them better insulated in the winter,
p289
aVto not leak energy in the summer,
p290
aVnot leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.
p291
aVBogota, where Mayor Mockus,
p292
aVwhen he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system
p293
aVthat saved energy, that allowed surface buses
p294
aVto run in effect like subways,
p295
aVexpress buses with corridors.
p296
aVIt helped unemployment, because people could get across town,
p297
aVand it had a profound impact on climate as well as
p298
aVmany other things there.
p299
aVSingapore, as it developed its high-rises
p300
aVand its remarkable public housing,
p301
aValso developed an island of parks,
p302
aVand if you go there, you'll see how much of it
p303
aVis green land and park land.
p304
aVCities are doing this, but not just one by one.
p305
aVThey are doing it together.
p306
aVThey are sharing what they do,
p307
aVand they are making a difference by shared best practices.
p308
aVBike shares, many of you have heard of it,
p309
aVstarted 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.
p310
aVNow it's in hundreds of cities around the world.
p311
aVPedestrian zones, congestion fees,
p312
aVemission limits in cities like California cities have,
p313
aVthere's lots and lots that cities can do
p314
aVeven when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo what's the bottom line here?
p317
aVThe bottom line is, we still live politically
p318
aVin a world of borders, a world of boundaries,
p319
aVa world of walls,
p320
aVa world where states refuse to act together.
p321
aVYet we know that the reality we experience
p322
aVday to day is a world without borders,
p323
aVa world of diseases without borders
p324
aVand doctors without borders,
p325
aVmaladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,
p326
aVof economics and technology without borders,
p327
aVof education without borders,
p328
aVof terrorism and war without borders.
p329
aVThat is the real world, and unless we find a way
p330
aVto globalize democracy or democratize globalization,
p331
aVwe will increasingly not only risk
p332
aVthe failure to address all of these transnational problems,
p333
aVbut we will risk losing democracy itself,
p334
aVlocked up in the old nation-state box,
p335
aVunable to address global problems democratically.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo where does that leave us?
p338
aVI'll tell you. The road to global democracy
p339
aVdoesn't run through states.
p340
aVIt runs through cities.
p341
aVDemocracy was born in the ancient polis.
p342
aVI believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.
p343
aVIn that journey from polis to cosmopolis,
p344
aVwe can rediscover the power
p345
aVof democracy on a global level.
p346
aVWe can create not a League of Nations, which failed,
p347
aVbut a League of Cities,
p348
aVnot a United or a dis-United Nations,
p349
aVbut United Cities of the World.
p350
aVWe can create a global parliament of mayors.
p351
aVThat's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,
p352
aVbut it's also on the table in City Halls
p353
aVin Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,
p354
aVin Hamburg, and in New York.
p355
aVMayors are considering that idea of how you can actually
p356
aVconstitute a global parliament of mayors,
p357
aVand I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors
p358
aVis a parliament of citizens
p359
aVand a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,
p360
aVof you and of me.
p361
aa(lp362
VIf ever there were citizens without borders,
p363
aVI think it's the citizens of TED
p364
aVwho show the promise to be those citizens without borders.
p365
aVI am ready to reach out and embrace
p366
aVa new global democracy,
p367
aVto take back our democracy.
p368
aVAnd the only question is,
p369
aVare you?
p370
aa(lp371
VThank you so much, my fellow citizens.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Applause)
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you. (Applause)
