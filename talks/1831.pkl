VSo I wanted to tell a story
p5
aVthat really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,
p6
aVand it's a story of something that happened
p7
aV3,000 years ago,
p8
aVwhen the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
p9
aVAnd it takes place in an area called the Shephelah
p10
aVin what is now Israel.
p11
aVAnd the reason the story obsessed me is that
p12
aVI thought I understood it, and then I went back over it
p13
aVand I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
p14
aa(lp15
VAncient Palestine had a \u2014 along its eastern border,
p16
aVthere's a mountain range.
p17
aVStill same is true of Israel today.
p18
aVAnd in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities
p19
aVof that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.
p20
aVAnd then there's a coastal plain
p21
aValong the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.
p22
aVAnd connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain
p23
aVis an area called the Shephelah,
p24
aVwhich is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,
p25
aVand you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah
p26
aVto get from the coastal plain to the mountains.
p27
aVAnd the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know
p28
aVit's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.
p29
aVIt's gorgeous, with forests of oak
p30
aVand wheat fields and vineyards.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut more importantly, though, in the history of that region,
p33
aVit's served, it's had a real strategic function,
p34
aVand that is, it is the means by which hostile armies
p35
aVon the coastal plain find their way,
p36
aVget up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.
p37
aVAnd 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.
p38
aVThe Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies
p39
aVof the Kingdom of Israel,
p40
aVare living in the coastal plain.
p41
aVThey're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.
p42
aVAnd they may start to make their way
p43
aVthrough one of the valleys of the Shephelah
p44
aVup into the mountains,
p45
aVbecause what they want to do is occupy the highland area
p46
aVright by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.
p47
aVAnd the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,
p48
aVobviously catches wind of this,
p49
aVand Saul brings his army down from the mountains
p50
aVand he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,
p51
aVone of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.
p52
aVAnd the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,
p53
aVand the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,
p54
aVand the two armies just sit there for weeks
p55
aVand stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.
p56
aVNeither can attack the other, because to attack the other side
p57
aVyou've got to come down the mountain into the valley
p58
aVand then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo finally, to break the deadlock,
p61
aVthe Philistines send their mightiest warrior
p62
aVdown into the valley floor, and he calls out
p63
aVand he says to the Israelites,
p64
aV"Send your mightiest warrior down,
p65
aVand we'll have this out, just the two of us."
p66
aa(lp67
VThis was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.
p68
aVIt was a way of settling disputes
p69
aVwithout incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.
p70
aVAnd the Philistine who is sent down,
p71
aVtheir mighty warrior, is a giant.
p72
aVHe's 6 foot 9.
p73
aVHe's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,
p74
aVand he's got a sword and he's got a javelin
p75
aVand he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.
p76
aVAnd he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.
p77
aVIt's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd finally the only person who will come forward
p80
aVis this young shepherd boy,
p81
aVand he goes up to Saul and he says, "I'll fight him."
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd Saul says, "You can't fight him. That's ridiculous.
p84
aVYou're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."
p85
aa(lp86
VBut the shepherd is adamant. He says, "No, no, no,
p87
aVyou don't understand, I have been defending my flock
p88
aVagainst lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.
p91
aVSo he says, "All right."
p92
aVAnd then he turns to the kid, and he says,
p93
aV"But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."
p94
aa(lp95
VSo he tries to give the shepherd his armor,
p96
aVand the shepherd says, "No."
p97
aVHe says, "I can't wear this stuff."
p98
aVThe Biblical verse is, "I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"
p99
aVmeaning, "I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."
p100
aa(lp101
VSo he reaches down instead on the ground
p102
aVand picks up five stones
p103
aVand puts them in his shepherd's bag
p104
aVand starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.
p105
aVAnd the giant sees this figure approaching,
p106
aVand calls out, "Come to me so I can feed your flesh
p107
aVto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."
p108
aVHe issues this kind of taunt towards this person
p109
aVcoming to fight him.
p110
aVAnd the shepherd draws closer and closer,
p111
aVand the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.
p112
aVThat's all he's carrying.
p113
aVInstead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,
p114
aVand he says \u2014 he's insulted \u2014
p115
aV"Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd the shepherd boy takes one of his stones
p118
aVout of his pocket, puts it in his sling
p119
aVand rolls it around and lets it fly
p120
aVand it hits the giant right between the eyes \u2014
p121
aVright here, in his most vulnerable spot \u2014
p122
aVand he falls down either dead or unconscious,
p123
aVand the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword
p124
aVand cuts off his head,
p125
aVand the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd of course, the name of the giant is Goliath
p128
aVand the name of the shepherd boy is David,
p129
aVand the reason that story has obsessed me
p130
aVover the course of writing my book
p131
aVis that everything I thought I knew about that story
p132
aVturned out to be wrong.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?
p135
aVIn fact, that term, David and Goliath,
p136
aVhas entered our language as a metaphor for
p137
aVimprobable victories
p138
aVby some weak party over someone far stronger.
p139
aVNow why do we call David an underdog?
p140
aVWell, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,
p141
aVa little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.
p142
aVWe also call him an underdog
p143
aVbecause Goliath is an experienced warrior,
p144
aVand David is just a shepherd.
p145
aVBut most importantly, we call him an underdog
p146
aVbecause all he has is \u2014 it's that Goliath is outfitted with
p147
aVall of this modern weaponry,
p148
aVthis glittering coat of armor
p149
aVand a sword and a javelin and a spear,
p150
aVand all David has is this sling.
p151
aa(lp152
VWell, let's start there with the phrase
p153
aV"All David has is this sling,"
p154
aVbecause that's the first mistake that we make.
p155
aVIn ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.
p156
aVThere's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
p157
aVThere's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,
p158
aVarmed foot soldiers with swords and shields
p159
aVand some kind of armor.
p160
aVAnd there's artillery, and artillery are archers,
p161
aVbut, more importantly, slingers.
p162
aVAnd a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch
p163
aVwith two long cords attached to it,
p164
aVand they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,
p165
aVinside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this
p166
aVand they let one of the cords go,
p167
aVand the effect is to send the projectile forward
p168
aVtowards its target.
p169
aVThat's what David has, and it's important to understand
p170
aVthat that sling is not a slingshot.
p171
aVIt's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.
p172
aVIt's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
p173
aVWhen David rolls it around like this,
p174
aVhe's turning the sling around probably
p175
aVat six or seven revolutions per second,
p176
aVand that means that when the rock is released,
p177
aVit's going forward really fast,
p178
aVprobably 35 meters per second.
p179
aVThat's substantially faster than a baseball
p180
aVthrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.
p181
aVMore than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah
p182
aVwere not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,
p183
aVwhich are rocks twice the density of normal stones.
p184
aVIf you do the calculations on the ballistics,
p185
aVon the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,
p186
aVit's roughly equal to the stopping power
p187
aVof a [.45 caliber] handgun.
p188
aVThis is an incredibly devastating weapon.
p189
aVAccuracy, we know from historical records
p190
aVthat slingers \u2014 experienced slingers could hit
p191
aVand maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.
p192
aVFrom medieval tapestries, we know that slingers
p193
aVwere capable of hitting birds in flight.
p194
aVThey were incredibly accurate.
p195
aVWhen David lines up \u2014 and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,
p196
aVhe's quite close to Goliath \u2014
p197
aVwhen he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,
p198
aVhe has every intention and every expectation
p199
aVof being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot
p200
aVbetween his eyes.
p201
aVIf you go back over the history of ancient warfare,
p202
aVyou will find time and time again
p203
aVthat slingers were the decisive factor against infantry
p204
aVin one kind of battle or another.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,
p207
aVand his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel
p208
aVis that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.
p209
aVWhen he says, "Come to me that I might
p210
aVfeed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"
p211
aVthe key phrase is "Come to me."
p212
aVCome up to me because we're going to fight,
p213
aVhand to hand, like this.
p214
aVSaul has the same expectation.
p215
aVDavid says, "I want to fight Goliath,"
p216
aVand Saul tries to give him his armor,
p217
aVbecause Saul is thinking, "Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'
p218
aVyou mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'
p219
aVinfantry on infantry."
p220
aa(lp221
VBut David has absolutely no expectation.
p222
aVHe's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?
p223
aVHe's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career
p224
aVusing a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.
p225
aVThat's where his strength lies.
p226
aVSo here he is, this shepherd, experienced
p227
aVin the use of a devastating weapon,
p228
aVup against this lumbering giant
p229
aVweighed down by a hundred pounds of armor
p230
aVand these incredibly heavy weapons
p231
aVthat are useful only in short-range combat.
p232
aVGoliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.
p233
aVSo why do we keep calling David an underdog,
p234
aVand why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?
p235
aa(lp236
VThere's a second piece of this that's important.
p237
aVIt's not just that we misunderstand David
p238
aVand his choice of weaponry.
p239
aVIt's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.
p240
aVGoliath is not what he seems to be.
p241
aVThere's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,
p242
aVthings that are in retrospect quite puzzling
p243
aVand don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.
p244
aVSo to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath
p245
aVis led onto the valley floor by an attendant.
p246
aVNow that is weird, right?
p247
aVHere is this mighty warrior
p248
aVchallenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.
p249
aVWhy is he being led by the hand
p250
aVby some young boy, presumably,
p251
aVto the point of combat?
p252
aVSecondly, the Bible story makes special note
p253
aVof how slowly Goliath moves,
p254
aVanother odd thing to say when you're describing
p255
aVthe mightiest warrior known to man at that point.
p256
aVAnd then there's this whole weird thing
p257
aVabout how long it takes Goliath to react
p258
aVto the sight of David.
p259
aVSo David's coming down the mountain,
p260
aVand he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.
p261
aVThere is nothing about him that says,
p262
aV"I am about to fight you like this."
p263
aVHe's not even carrying a sword.
p264
aVWhy does Goliath not react to that?
p265
aVIt's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.
p266
aVAnd then there's that strange comment he makes to David:
p267
aV"Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"
p268
aVSticks? David only has one stick.
p269
aa(lp270
VWell, it turns out that there's been a great deal
p271
aVof speculation within the medical community over the years
p272
aVabout whether there is something
p273
aVfundamentally wrong with Goliath,
p274
aVan attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.
p275
aVThere have been many articles written.
p276
aVThe first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,
p277
aVand it started a chain of speculation
p278
aVthat starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.
p279
aVSo Goliath is head and shoulders above
p280
aVall of his peers in that era,
p281
aVand usually when someone is that far out of the norm,
p282
aVthere's an explanation for it.
p283
aVSo the most common form of giantism
p284
aVis a condition called acromegaly,
p285
aVand acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor
p286
aVon your pituitary gland
p287
aVthat causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.
p288
aVAnd throughout history, many of the most famous giants
p289
aVhave all had acromegaly.
p290
aVSo the tallest person of all time
p291
aVwas a guy named Robert Wadlow
p292
aVwho was still growing when he died at the age of 24
p293
aVand he was 8 foot 11.
p294
aVHe had acromegaly.
p295
aVDo you remember the wrestler André the Giant?
p296
aVFamous. He had acromegaly.
p297
aVThere's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.
p298
aVAnyone who's unusually tall,
p299
aVthat's the first explanation we come up with.
p300
aVAnd acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects
p301
aVassociated with it,
p302
aVprincipally having to do with vision.
p303
aVThe pituitary tumor, as it grows,
p304
aVoften starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,
p305
aVwith the result that people with acromegaly
p306
aVhave either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo when people have started to speculate
p309
aVabout what might have been wrong with Goliath,
p310
aVthey've said, "Wait a minute,
p311
aVhe looks and sounds an awful lot like someone
p312
aVwho has acromegaly."
p313
aVAnd that would also explain so much of what was strange
p314
aVabout his behavior that day.
p315
aVWhy does he move so slowly
p316
aVand have to be escorted down into the valley floor
p317
aVby an attendant?
p318
aVBecause he can't make his way on his own.
p319
aVWhy is he so strangely oblivious to David
p320
aVthat he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him
p321
aVuntil the very last moment?
p322
aVBecause he can't see him.
p323
aVWhen he says, "Come to me that I might feed your flesh
p324
aVto the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"
p325
aVthe phrase "come to me" is a hint also of his vulnerability.
p326
aVCome to me because I can't see you.
p327
aVAnd then there's, "Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"
p328
aVHe sees two sticks when David has only one.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo the Israelites up on the mountain ridge
p331
aVlooking down on him thought he was
p332
aVthis extraordinarily powerful foe.
p333
aVWhat they didn't understand was that
p334
aVthe very thing that was the source of his apparent strength
p335
aVwas also the source of his greatest weakness.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd there is, I think, in that,
p338
aVa very important lesson for all of us.
p339
aVGiants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.
p340
aVAnd sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you.
