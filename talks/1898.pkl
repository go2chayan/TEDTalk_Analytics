VHello, TEDWomen, what's up.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Cheering)
p7
aa(lp8
VNot good enough.
p9
aVHello, TEDWomen, what is up?
p10
aa(lp11
V(Loud cheering)
p12
aa(lp13
VMy name is Maysoon Zayid,
p14
aVand I am not drunk,
p15
aVbut the doctor who delivered me was.
p16
aVHe cut my mom six different times
p17
aVin six different directions,
p18
aVsuffocating poor little me in the process.
p19
aVAs a result, I have cerebral palsy,
p20
aVwhich means I shake all the time.
p21
aVLook.
p22
aVIt's exhausting.
p23
aVI'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VCP is not genetic.
p28
aVIt's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
p29
aVNo one put a curse on my mother's uterus,
p30
aVand I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins,
p31
aVwhich they are.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VIt only happens from accidents,
p36
aVlike what happened to me on my birth day.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, I must warn you,
p39
aVI'm not inspirational.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me,
p44
aVbecause at some point in your life,
p45
aVyou have dreamt of being disabled.
p46
aVCome on a journey with me.
p47
aVIt's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,
p48
aVyou're driving around in circles looking for parking,
p49
aVand what do you see?
p50
aVSixteen empty handicapped spaces.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAlso, I've got to tell you,
p59
aVI've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VIf there was an Oppression Olympics,
p64
aVI would win the gold medal.
p65
aVI'm Palestinian, Muslim,
p66
aVI'm female, I'm disabled,
p67
aVand I live in New Jersey.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VIf you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VCliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.
p78
aVI have always loved the fact
p79
aVthat my hood and my affliction share the same initials.
p80
aVI also love the fact
p81
aVthat if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.
p82
aa(lp83
VA lot of people with CP don't walk,
p84
aVbut my parents didn't believe in "can't."
p85
aVMy father's mantra was,
p86
aV"You can do it, yes you can can."
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aVSo, if my three older sisters were mopping,
p90
aVI was mopping.
p91
aVIf my three older sisters went to public school,
p92
aVmy parents would sue the school system
p93
aVand guarantee that I went too,
p94
aVand if we didn't all get A's,
p95
aVwe all got my mother's slipper.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VMy father taught me how to walk when I was five years old
p100
aVby placing my heels on his feet
p101
aVand just walking.
p102
aVAnother tactic that he used
p103
aVis he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me
p104
aVand have me chase it.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VMy inner stripper was very strong.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VYeah.
p113
aVNo, by the first day of kindergarten,
p114
aVI was walking like a champ
p115
aVwho had been punched one too many times.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VGrowing up, there were only six Arabs in my town,
p120
aVand they were all my family.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VNow there are 20 Arabs in town,
p125
aVand they are still all my family.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VI don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
V(Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VThis was before 9/11
p136
aVand before politicians thought it was appropriate
p137
aVto use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.
p138
aVThe people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
p139
aVThey did, however, seem very concerned
p140
aVthat I would starve to death during Ramadan.
p141
aVI would explain to them that I have enough fat
p142
aVto live off of for three whole months,
p143
aVso fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VI have tap-danced on Broadway.
p148
aVYeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VMy parents couldn't afford physical therapy,
p153
aVso they sent me to dancing school.
p154
aVI learned how to dance in heels,
p155
aVwhich means I can walk in heels.
p156
aVAnd I'm from Jersey,
p157
aVand we are really concerned with being chic,
p158
aVso if my friends wore heels, so did I.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd when my friends went and spent their summer vacations
p161
aVon the Jersey Shore, I did not.
p162
aVI spent my summers in a war zone,
p163
aVbecause my parents were afraid
p164
aVthat if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer,
p165
aVwe'd grow up to be Madonna.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VSummer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me,
p170
aVso I drank deer's milk,
p171
aVI had hot cups on my back,
p172
aVI was dunked in the Dead Sea,
p173
aVand I remember the water burning my eyes
p174
aVand thinking, "It's working! It's working!"
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VBut one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
p179
aVI have to tell you, it's very boring,
p180
aVbut before I did yoga,
p181
aVI was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.
p182
aVAnd now I can stand on my head.
p183
aVMy parents reinforced this notion
p184
aVthat I could do anything,
p185
aVthat no dream was impossible,
p186
aVand my dream was to be
p187
aVon the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VI went to college during affirmative action
p192
aVand got a sweet scholarship to ASU,
p193
aVArizona State University,
p194
aVbecause I fit every single quota.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VI was like the pet lemur of the theater department.
p199
aVEverybody loved me.
p200
aVI did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework,
p201
aVI got A's in all of my classes,
p202
aVA's in all of their classes.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VEvery time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie,"
p207
aVmy professors would weep.
p208
aVBut I never got cast.
p209
aVFinally, my senior year,
p210
aVASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."
p211
aVIt's a play about a girl with CP.
p212
aVI was a girl with CP.
p213
aVSo I start shouting from the rooftops,
p214
aV"I'm finally going to get a part!
p215
aVI have cerebral palsy!
p216
aVFree at last! Free at last!
p217
aVThank God almighty, I'm free at last!"
p218
aVI didn't get the part.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VSherry Brown got the part.
p223
aVI went racing to the head of the theater department
p224
aVcrying hysterically, like someone shot my cat,
p225
aVto ask her why,
p226
aVand she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.
p227
aVI said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts,
p228
aVneither can the character."
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VThis was a part that I was literally born to play
p235
aVthey gave it to a non-palsy actress.
p236
aVCollege was imitating life.
p237
aVHollywood has a sordid history
p238
aVof casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.
p239
aa(lp240
VUpon graduating, I moved back home,
p241
aVand my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.
p242
aVMy dream was coming true.
p243
aVAnd I knew that I would be promoted
p244
aVfrom "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VBut instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture
p249
aVthat you could only recognize from the back of my head,
p250
aVand it became clear to me
p251
aVthat casting directors
p252
aVdidn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.
p253
aVThey only hired perfect people.
p254
aVBut there were exceptions to the rule.
p255
aVI grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,
p256
aVRoseanne Barr, Ellen,
p257
aVand all of these women had one thing in common:
p258
aVthey were comedians.
p259
aVSo I became a comic.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
V(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VMy first gig was driving famous comics
p266
aVfrom New York City to shows in New Jersey,
p267
aVand I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove
p268
aVwhen he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike
p269
aVwith a chick with CP driving him.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VI've performed in clubs all over America,
p274
aVand I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East,
p275
aVuncensored and uncovered.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VSome people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.
p280
aVI never like to claim first,
p281
aVbut I do know that they never heard
p282
aVthat nasty little rumor that women aren't funny,
p283
aVand they find us hysterical.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VIn 2003, my brother from another mother and father
p288
aVDean Obeidallah and I started
p289
aVthe New York Arab-American Comedy Festival,
p290
aVnow in its 10th year.
p291
aVOur goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media,
p292
aVwhile also reminding casting directors
p293
aVthat South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VMainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier
p298
aVthan conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.
p299
aa(lp300
VMy big break came in 2010.
p301
aVI was invited to be a guest on the cable news show
p302
aV"Countdown with Keith Olbermann."
p303
aVI walked in looking like I was going to the prom,
p304
aVand they shuffle me into a studio
p305
aVand seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VSo I looked at the stage manager
p310
aVand I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"
p311
aVAnd she looked at me and she went,
p312
aV"Five, four, three, two ..."
p313
aVAnd we were live, right?
p314
aVSo I had to grip onto the anchor's desk
p315
aVso that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment,
p316
aVand when the interview was over, I was livid.
p317
aVI had finally gotten my chance and I blew it,
p318
aVand I knew I would never get invited back.
p319
aVBut not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back,
p320
aVhe made me a full-time contributor,
p321
aVand he taped down my chair.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
V(Applause)
p326
aa(lp327
VOne fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann
p328
aVwas that humans on the Internet are scumbags.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aVPeople say children are cruel,
p332
aVbut I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.
p333
aVSuddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.
p334
aVI would look at clips online and see comments like,
p335
aV"Yo, why's she tweakin'?"
p336
aV"Yo, is she retarded?"
p337
aVAnd my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.
p338
aVWhat does she suffer from?
p339
aVWe should really pray for her."
p340
aVOne commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits:
p341
aVscreenwriter, comedian, palsy.
p342
aa(lp343
VDisability is as visual as race.
p344
aVIf a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,
p345
aVthen Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.
p346
aVThe disabled are the largest \u2014
p347
aVYeah, clap for that, man. Come on.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Applause)
p350
aa(lp351
VPeople with disabilities are the largest minority in the world,
p352
aVand we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe doctors said that I wouldn't walk,
p355
aVbut I am here in front of you.
p356
aVHowever, if I grew up with social media,
p357
aVI don't think I would be.
p358
aVI hope that together,
p359
aVwe can create more positive images
p360
aVof disability in the media and in everyday life.
p361
aVPerhaps if there were more positive images,
p362
aVit would foster less hate on the Internet.
p363
aVOr maybe not.
p364
aVMaybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
p365
aa(lp366
VMy crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.
p367
aVI got to walk the red carpet
p368
aVflanked by soap diva Susan Lucci
p369
aVand the iconic Loreen Arbus.
p370
aVI got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler
p371
aVand work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.
p372
aVI toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.
p373
aVI was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey
p374
aVat the 2008 DNC.
p375
aVAnd I founded Maysoon's Kids,
p376
aVa charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children
p377
aVa sliver of the chance my parents gave me.
p378
aVBut the one moment that stands out the most
p379
aVwas when I got \u2014 before this moment \u2014
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
V(Applause)
p384
aa(lp385
VBut the one moment that stands out the most
p386
aVwas when I got to perform
p387
aVfor the man who floats like a butterfly
p388
aVand stings like a bee,
p389
aVhas Parkinson's and shakes just like me,
p390
aVMuhammad Ali.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Applause)
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause ends)
p395
aa(lp396
VIt was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live,
p397
aVand I dedicate this talk to his memory.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.
p400
aa(lp401
V(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,
p402
aVand if I can can, you can can.
