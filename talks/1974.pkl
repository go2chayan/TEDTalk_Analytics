VWhen I was born,
p5
aVthere was really only one book
p6
aVabout how to raise your children,
p7
aVand it was written by Dr. Spock.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVThank you for indulging me.
p10
aVI have always wanted to do that.
p11
aa(lp12
VNo, it was Benjamin Spock,
p13
aVand his book was called "The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care."
p14
aVIt sold almost 50 million copies  by the time he died.
p15
aVToday, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,
p16
aVwalk into Barnes and Noble,
p17
aVand see this.
p18
aVAnd it is amazing
p19
aVthe variety that one finds  on those shelves.
p20
aVThere are guides to raising  an eco-friendly kid,
p21
aVa gluten-free kid,
p22
aVa disease-proof kid,
p23
aVwhich, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.
p24
aVThere are guides to raising a bilingual kid
p25
aVeven if you only speak one language at home.
p26
aVThere are guides to raising a financially savvy kid
p27
aVand a science-minded kid
p28
aVand a kid who is a whiz at yoga.
p29
aVShort of teaching your toddler how to defuse
p30
aVa nuclear bomb,
p31
aVthere is pretty much a guide to everything.
p32
aa(lp33
VAll of these books are well-intentioned.
p34
aVI am sure that many of them are great.
p35
aVBut taken together, I am sorry,
p36
aVI do not see help
p37
aVwhen I look at that shelf.
p38
aVI see anxiety.
p39
aVI see a giant candy-colored monument
p40
aVto our collective panic,
p41
aVand it makes me want to know,
p42
aVwhy is it that raising our children
p43
aVis associated with so much anguish
p44
aVand so much confusion?
p45
aVWhy is it that we are at sixes and sevens
p46
aVabout the one thing human beings
p47
aVhave been doing successfully for millennia,
p48
aVlong before parenting message boards
p49
aVand peer-reviewed studies came along?
p50
aVWhy is it that so many mothers and fathers
p51
aVexperience parenthood as a kind of crisis?
p52
aa(lp53
VCrisis might seem like a strong word,
p54
aVbut there is data suggesting it probably isn't.
p55
aVThere was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,
p56
aV"Parenthood as Crisis," published in 1957,
p57
aVand in the 50-plus years since,
p58
aVthere has been plenty of scholarship
p59
aVdocumenting a pretty clear pattern
p60
aVof parental anguish.
p61
aVParents experience more stress than non-parents.
p62
aVTheir marital satisfaction is lower.
p63
aVThere have been a number of studies
p64
aVlooking at how parents feel
p65
aVwhen they are spending time with their kids,
p66
aVand the answer often is, not so great.
p67
aVLast year, I spoke with a researcher
p68
aVnamed Matthew Killingsworth
p69
aVwho is doing a very, very imaginative project
p70
aVthat tracks people's happiness,
p71
aVand here is what he told me he found:
p72
aV"Interacting with your friends
p73
aVis better than interacting with your spouse,
p74
aVwhich is better than interacting with other relatives,
p75
aVwhich is better than interacting with acquaintances,
p76
aVwhich is better than interacting with parents,
p77
aVwhich is better than interacting with children.
p78
aVWho are on par with strangers."
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VBut here's the thing.
p82
aVI have been looking at what underlies these data
p83
aVfor three years,
p84
aVand children are not the problem.
p85
aVSomething about parenting right now at this moment
p86
aVis the problem.
p87
aVSpecifically, I don't think we know
p88
aVwhat parenting is supposed to be.
p89
aVParent, as a verb,
p90
aVonly entered common usage in 1970.
p91
aVOur roles as mothers and fathers have changed.
p92
aVThe roles of our children have changed.
p93
aVWe are all now furiously improvising
p94
aVour way through a situation
p95
aVfor which there is no script,
p96
aVand if you're an amazing jazz musician,
p97
aVthen improv is great,
p98
aVbut for the rest of us,
p99
aVit can kind of feel like a crisis.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo how did we get here?
p102
aVHow is it that we are all now navigating
p103
aVa child-rearing universe
p104
aVwithout any norms to guide us?
p105
aVWell, for starters, there has been
p106
aVa major historical change.
p107
aVUntil fairly recently,
p108
aVkids worked, on our farms primarily,
p109
aVbut also in factories, mills, mines.
p110
aVKids were considered economic assets.
p111
aVSometime during the Progressive Era,
p112
aVwe put an end to this arrangement.
p113
aVWe recognized kids had rights,
p114
aVwe banned child labor,
p115
aVwe focused on education instead,
p116
aVand school became a child's new work.
p117
aVAnd thank God it did.
p118
aVBut that only made a parent's role
p119
aVmore confusing in a way.
p120
aVThe old arrangement might not have been
p121
aVparticularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.
p122
aVWe provided food, clothing, shelter,
p123
aVand moral instruction to our kids,
p124
aVand they in return provided income.
p125
aa(lp126
VOnce kids stopped working,
p127
aVthe economics of parenting changed.
p128
aVKids became, in the words of one
p129
aVbrilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,
p130
aV"economically worthless but emotionally priceless."
p131
aVRather than them working for us,
p132
aVwe began to work for them,
p133
aVbecause within only a matter of decades
p134
aVit became clear:
p135
aVif we wanted our kids to succeed,
p136
aVschool was not enough.
p137
aVToday, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,
p138
aVbut that's work for us too,
p139
aVbecause we are the ones driving them to soccer practice.
p140
aVMassive piles of homework are a kid's new work,
p141
aVbut that's also work for us,
p142
aVbecause we have to check it.
p143
aVAbout three years ago, a Texas woman
p144
aVtold something to me
p145
aVthat totally broke my heart.
p146
aVShe said, almost casually,
p147
aV"Homework is the new dinner."
p148
aVThe middle class now pours all of its time
p149
aVand energy and resources into its kids,
p150
aVeven though the middle class
p151
aVhas less and less of those things to give.
p152
aVMothers now spend more time with their children
p153
aVthan they did in 1965,
p154
aVwhen most women were not even in the workforce.
p155
aa(lp156
VIt would probably be easier for parents
p157
aVto do their new roles
p158
aVif they knew what they were preparing their kids for.
p159
aVThis is yet another thing that makes modern parenting
p160
aVso very confounding.
p161
aVWe have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,
p162
aVis of use to our kids.
p163
aVThe world is changing so rapidly,
p164
aVit's impossible to say.
p165
aVThis was true even when I was young.
p166
aVWhen I was a kid, high school specifically,
p167
aVI was told that I would be at sea
p168
aVin the new global economy
p169
aVif I did not know Japanese.
p170
aVAnd with all due respect to the Japanese,
p171
aVit didn't turn out that way.
p172
aVNow there is a certain kind of middle-class parent
p173
aVthat is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,
p174
aVand maybe they're onto something,
p175
aVbut we cannot know for sure.
p176
aVSo, absent being able to anticipate the future,
p177
aVwhat we all do, as good parents,
p178
aVis try and prepare our kids
p179
aVfor every possible kind of future,
p180
aVhoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.
p181
aVWe teach our kids chess,
p182
aVthinking maybe they will need analytical skills.
p183
aVWe sign them up for team sports,
p184
aVthinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,
p185
aVyou know, for when they go to Harvard Business School.
p186
aVWe try and teach them to be financially savvy
p187
aVand science-minded and eco-friendly
p188
aVand gluten-free,
p189
aVthough now is probably a good time to tell you
p190
aVthat I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.
p191
aVI ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.
p192
aVAnd you know what? I'm doing okay.
p193
aVI pay my taxes.
p194
aVI hold down a steady job.
p195
aVI was even invited to speak at TED.
p196
aVBut the presumption now is that
p197
aVwhat was good enough for me, or for my folks for that matter,
p198
aVisn't good enough anymore.
p199
aVSo we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,
p200
aVbecause we feel like if we aren't trying everything,
p201
aVit's as if we're doing nothing
p202
aVand we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo it's hard enough to navigate our new roles
p205
aVas mothers and fathers.
p206
aVNow add to this problem something else:
p207
aVwe are also navigating new roles
p208
aVas husbands and wives
p209
aVbecause most women today are in the workforce.
p210
aVThis is another reason, I think,
p211
aVthat parenthood feels like a crisis.
p212
aVWe have no rules, no scripts, no norms
p213
aVfor what to do when a child comes along
p214
aVnow that both mom and dad are breadwinners.
p215
aVThe writer Michael Lewis once put this
p216
aVvery, very well.
p217
aVHe said that the surest way
p218
aVfor a couple to start fighting
p219
aVis for them to go out to dinner with another couple
p220
aVwhose division of labor
p221
aVis ever so slightly different from theirs,
p222
aVbecause the conversation in the car on the way home
p223
aVgoes something like this:
p224
aV"So, did you catch that Dave is the one
p225
aVwho walks them to school every morning?"
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVWithout scripts telling us who does what
p228
aVin this brave new world, couples fight,
p229
aVand both mothers and fathers each have
p230
aVtheir legitimate gripes.
p231
aVMothers are much more likely
p232
aVto be multi-tasking when they are at home,
p233
aVand fathers, when they are at home,
p234
aVare much more likely to be mono-tasking.
p235
aVFind a guy at home, and odds are
p236
aVhe is doing just one thing at a time.
p237
aVIn fact, UCLA recently did a study
p238
aVlooking at the most common configuration
p239
aVof family members in middle-class homes.
p240
aVGuess what it was?
p241
aVDad in a room by himself.
p242
aVAccording to the American Time Use Survey,
p243
aVmothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,
p244
aVwhich is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,
p245
aVbut I still think that something she wrote
p246
aVis highly relevant:
p247
aV"I have not been alone in the bathroom since October."
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VBut here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.
p251
aVThey spend more time with their kids
p252
aVthan their fathers ever spent with them.
p253
aVThey work more paid hours, on average,
p254
aVthan their wives,
p255
aVand they genuinely want to be good,
p256
aVinvolved dads.
p257
aVToday, it is fathers, not mothers,
p258
aVwho report the most work-life conflict.
p259
aa(lp260
VEither way, by the way,
p261
aVif you think it's hard for traditional families
p262
aVto sort out these new roles,
p263
aVjust imagine what it's like now
p264
aVfor non-traditional families:
p265
aVfamilies with two dads, families with two moms,
p266
aVsingle-parent households.
p267
aVThey are truly improvising as they go.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, in a more progressive country,
p270
aVand forgive me here for capitulating to cliché
p271
aVand invoking, yes, Sweden,
p272
aVparents could rely on the state
p273
aVfor support.
p274
aVThere are countries that acknowledge
p275
aVthe anxieties and the changing roles
p276
aVof mothers and fathers.
p277
aVUnfortunately, the United States is not one of them,
p278
aVso in case you were wondering what the U.S.
p279
aVhas in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,
p280
aVit's this:
p281
aVWe too have no paid maternity leave policy.
p282
aVWe are one of eight known countries that does not.
p283
aa(lp284
VIn this age of intense confusion,
p285
aVthere is just one goal upon which
p286
aVall parents can agree,
p287
aVand that is whether they are
p288
aVtiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,
p289
aVour kids' happiness is paramount.
p290
aVThat is what it means
p291
aVto raise kids in an age
p292
aVwhen they are economically worthless
p293
aVbut emotionally priceless.
p294
aVWe are all the custodians of their self-esteem.
p295
aVThe one mantra no parent ever questions is,
p296
aV"All I want is for my children to be happy."
p297
aVAnd don't get me wrong:
p298
aVI think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.
p299
aVBut it is a very elusive one.
p300
aVHappiness and self-confidence,
p301
aVteaching children that is not like teaching them
p302
aVhow to plow a field.
p303
aVIt's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.
p304
aVThere's no curriculum for it.
p305
aVHappiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things,
p306
aVbut they cannot really be goals unto themselves.
p307
aVA child's happiness
p308
aVis a very unfair burden to place on a parent.
p309
aVAnd happiness is an even more unfair burden
p310
aVto place on a kid.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd I have to tell you,
p313
aVI think it leads to some very strange excesses.
p314
aVWe are now so anxious
p315
aVto protect our kids from the world's ugliness
p316
aVthat we now shield them from "Sesame Street."
p317
aVI wish I could say I was kidding about this,
p318
aVbut if you go out and you buy
p319
aVthe first few episodes of "Sesame Street" on DVD,
p320
aVas I did out of nostalgia,
p321
aVyou will find a warning at the beginning
p322
aVsaying that the content is not suitable
p323
aVfor children.
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aVCan I just repeat that?
p326
aVThe content of the original "Sesame Street"
p327
aVis not suitable for children.
p328
aVWhen asked about this by The New York Times,
p329
aVa producer for the show gave a variety of explanations.
p330
aVOne was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe
p331
aVin one skit and then swallowed it.
p332
aVBad modeling. I don't know.
p333
aVBut the thing that stuck with me
p334
aVis she said that she didn't know
p335
aVwhether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today
p336
aVbecause he was too depressive.
p337
aVI cannot tell you how much this distresses me.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVYou are looking at a woman
p340
aVwho has a periodic table of the Muppets
p341
aVhanging from her cubicle wall.
p342
aVThe offending muppet, right there.
p343
aa(lp344
VThat's my son the day he was born.
p345
aVI was high as a kite on morphine.
p346
aVI had had an unexpected C-section.
p347
aVBut even in my opiate haze,
p348
aVI managed to have one very clear thought
p349
aVthe first time I held him.
p350
aVI whispered it into his ear.
p351
aVI said, "I will try so hard not to hurt you."
p352
aVIt was the Hippocratic Oath,
p353
aVand I didn't even know I was saying it.
p354
aVBut it occurs to me now
p355
aVthat the Hippocratic Oath
p356
aVis a much more realistic aim than happiness.
p357
aVIn fact, as any parent will tell you,
p358
aVit's awfully hard.
p359
aVAll of us have said or done hurtful things
p360
aVthat we wish to God we could take back.
p361
aVI think in another era
p362
aVwe did not expect quite so much from ourselves,
p363
aVand it is important that we all remember that
p364
aVthe next time we are staring with our hearts racing
p365
aVat those bookshelves.
p366
aVI'm not really sure how to create new norms
p367
aVfor this world,
p368
aVbut I do think that
p369
aVin our desperate quest to create happy kids,
p370
aVwe may be assuming the wrong moral burden.
p371
aVIt strikes me as a better goal,
p372
aVand, dare I say, a more virtuous one,
p373
aVto focus on making productive kids
p374
aVand moral kids,
p375
aVand to simply hope that happiness will come to them
p376
aVby virtue of the good that they do
p377
aVand their accomplishments
p378
aVand the love that they feel from us.
p379
aVThat, anyway, is one response to having no script.
p380
aVAbsent having new scripts,
p381
aVwe just follow the oldest ones in the book \u2014
p382
aVdecency, a work ethic, love \u2014
p383
aVand let happiness and self-esteem take care of themselves.
p384
aVI think if we all did that,
p385
aVthe kids would still be all right,
p386
aVand so would their parents,
p387
aVpossibly in both cases even better.
p388
aa(lp389
VThank you.

Her conclusion: Hey, parents, it&#39;s okay not to feel blissfully happy all the time.<br /><br />She expanded the piece into a book that dives deeper into the research and paradoxes of modern American parenting styles -- including parents&#39; sometimes inflated expectations of constant awesomeness, meaningfulness and bliss.
