VThe Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."
p5
aVFaster, Higher, Stronger.
p6
aVAnd athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.
p7
aVThe winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon
p8
aVran two hours and eight minutes.
p9
aVHad he been racing against the winner
p10
aVof the 1904 Olympic marathon,
p11
aVhe would have won by nearly an hour and a half.
p12
aVNow we all have this feeling
p13
aVthat we're somehow just getting better
p14
aVas a human race, inexorably progressing,
p15
aVbut it's not like we've evolved into a new species
p16
aVin a century.
p17
aVSo what's going on here?
p18
aVI want to take a look at what's really behind
p19
aVthis march of athletic progress.
p20
aa(lp21
VIn 1936, Jesse Owens
p22
aVheld the world record in the 100 meters.
p23
aVHad Jesse Owens been racing last year
p24
aVin the world championships of the 100 meters,
p25
aVwhen Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,
p26
aVOwens would have still had 14 feet to go.
p27
aVThat's a lot in sprinter land.
p28
aVTo give you a sense of how much it is,
p29
aVI want to share with you a demonstration
p30
aVconceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.
p31
aVNow picture the stadium last year
p32
aVat the world championships of the 100 meters:
p33
aVthousands of fans waiting with baited breath
p34
aVto see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;
p35
aVflashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world
p36
aVcoil themselves into their blocks.
p37
aVAnd I want you to pretend
p38
aVthat Jesse Owens is in that race.
p39
aVNow close your eyes for a second and picture the race.
p40
aVBang! The gun goes off.
p41
aVAn American sprinter jumps out to the front.
p42
aVUsain Bolt starts to catch him.
p43
aVUsain Bolt passes him, and as the runners come to the finish,
p44
aVyou'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.
p45
aV(Beeps)
p46
aVThat's the entire finish of the race.
p47
aVYou can open your eyes now.
p48
aVThat first beep was Usain Bolt.
p49
aVThat last beep was Jesse Owens.
p50
aVListen to it again.
p51
aV(Beeps)
p52
aVWhen you think of it like that,
p53
aVit's not that big a difference, is it?
p54
aVAnd then consider that Usain Bolt started
p55
aVby propelling himself out of blocks
p56
aVdown a specially fabricated carpet
p57
aVdesigned to allow him to travel
p58
aVas fast as humanly possible.
p59
aVJesse Owens, on the other hand,
p60
aVran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,
p61
aVand that soft surface stole far more energy
p62
aVfrom his legs as he ran.
p63
aVRather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel
p64
aVthat he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from.
p65
aVBiomechanical analysis of the speed
p66
aVof Owens' joints shows that had been running
p67
aVon the same surface as Bolt,
p68
aVhe wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,
p69
aVhe would have been within one stride.
p70
aVRather than the last beep,
p71
aVOwens would have been the second beep.
p72
aVListen to it again.
p73
aV(Beeps)
p74
aVThat's the difference track surface technology has made,
p75
aVand it's done it throughout the running world.
p76
aa(lp77
VConsider a longer event.
p78
aVIn 1954, Sir Roger Bannister
p79
aVbecame the first man to run under four minutes in the mile.
p80
aVNowadays, college kids do that every year.
p81
aVOn rare occasions, a high school kid does it.
p82
aVAs of the end of last year,
p83
aV1,314 men
p84
aVhad run under four minutes in the mile,
p85
aVbut like Jesse Owens,
p86
aVSir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders
p87
aVthat stole far more energy from his legs
p88
aVthan the synthetic tracks of today.
p89
aVSo I consulted biomechanics experts
p90
aVto find out how much slower it is to run on cinders
p91
aVthan synthetic tracks,
p92
aVand their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower.
p93
aVSo if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion
p94
aVto every man who ran his sub-four mile
p95
aVon a synthetic track,
p96
aVthis is what happens.
p97
aVOnly 530 are left.
p98
aVIf you look at it from that perspective,
p99
aVfewer than ten new men per [year]
p100
aVhave joined the sub-four mile club
p101
aVsince Sir Roger Bannister.
p102
aVNow, 530 is a lot more than one,
p103
aVand that's partly because there are many more people
p104
aVtraining today and they're training more intelligently.
p105
aVEven college kids are professional in their training
p106
aVcompared to Sir Roger Bannister,
p107
aVwho trained for 45 minutes at a time
p108
aVwhile he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.
p109
aVAnd that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon
p110
aVin three in a half hours,
p111
aVthat guy was drinking rat poison and brandy
p112
aVwhile he ran along the course.
p113
aVThat was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VClearly, athletes have gotten more savvy
p117
aVabout performance-enhancing drugs as well,
p118
aVand that's made a difference in some sports at some times,
p119
aVbut technology has made a difference in all sports,
p120
aVfrom faster skis to lighter shoes.
p121
aVTake a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim.
p122
aVThe record is always trending downward,
p123
aVbut it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.
p124
aVThis first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction
p125
aVof the flip turn.
p126
aVRather than stopping and turning around,
p127
aVathletes could somersault under the water
p128
aVand get going right away in the opposite direction.
p129
aVThis second cliff, the introduction of gutters
p130
aVon the side of the pool
p131
aVthat allows water to splash off,
p132
aVrather than becoming turbulence
p133
aVthat impedes the swimmers as they race.
p134
aVThis final cliff,
p135
aVthe introduction of full-body
p136
aVand low-friction swimsuits.
p137
aa(lp138
VThroughout sports, technology has changed the face of performance.
p139
aVIn 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record
p140
aVfor the longest distance cycled in one hour
p141
aVat 30 miles, 3,774 feet.
p142
aVNow that record improved and improved
p143
aVas bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic
p144
aVall the way until 1996,
p145
aVwhen it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,
p146
aVnearly five miles farther
p147
aVthan Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.
p148
aVBut then in 2000, the International Cycling Union
p149
aVdecreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record
p150
aVhad to do so with essentially the same equipment
p151
aVthat Eddy Merckx used in 1972.
p152
aVWhere does the record stand today?
p153
aV30 miles, 4,657 feet,
p154
aVa grand total of 883 feet
p155
aVfarther than Eddy Merckx cycled
p156
aVmore than four decades ago.
p157
aVEssentially the entire improvement in this record
p158
aVwas due to technology.
p159
aa(lp160
VStill, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward.
p161
aVWhile indeed we haven't evolved
p162
aVinto a new species in a century,
p163
aVthe gene pool within competitive sports
p164
aVmost certainly has changed.
p165
aVIn the early half of the 20th century,
p166
aVphysical education instructors and coaches
p167
aVhad the idea that the average body type
p168
aVwas the best for all athletic endeavors:
p169
aVmedium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.
p170
aVAnd this showed in athletes' bodies.
p171
aVIn the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper
p172
aVand average elite shot-putter were the same exact size.
p173
aVBut as that idea started to fade away,
p174
aVas sports scientists and coaches realized that
p175
aVrather than the average body type,
p176
aVyou want highly specialized bodies
p177
aVthat fit into certain athletic niches,
p178
aVa form of artificial selection took place,
p179
aVa self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,
p180
aVand athletes' bodies became more different from one another.
p181
aVToday, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper,
p182
aVthe average elite shot-putter
p183
aVis two and a half inches taller
p184
aVand 130 pounds heavier.
p185
aVAnd this happened throughout the sports world.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph
p188
aVone data point for each of two dozen sports
p189
aVin the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.
p190
aVThere's some dispersal,
p191
aVbut it's kind of grouped around that average body type.
p192
aVThen that idea started to go away,
p193
aVand at the same time, digital technology \u2014
p194
aVfirst radio, then television and the Internet \u2014
p195
aVgave millions, or in some cases billions, of people
p196
aVa ticket to consume elite sports performance.
p197
aVThe financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,
p198
aVand it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance.
p199
aVIt accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies.
p200
aVAnd if you plot a data point for these same
p201
aVtwo dozen sports today, it looks like this.
p202
aVThe athletes' bodies have gotten
p203
aVmuch more different from one another.
p204
aVAnd because this chart looks like the charts
p205
aVthat show the expanding universe,
p206
aVwith the galaxies flying away from one another,
p207
aVthe scientists who discovered it call it
p208
aV"The Big Bang of Body Types."
p209
aa(lp210
VIn sports where height is prized, like basketball,
p211
aVthe tall athletes got taller.
p212
aVIn 1983, the National Basketball Association
p213
aVsigned a groundbreaking agreement
p214
aVmaking players partners in the league,
p215
aVentitled to shares of ticket revenues
p216
aVand television contracts.
p217
aVSuddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player
p218
aVwanted to be,
p219
aVand teams started scouring the globe
p220
aVfor the bodies that could help them win championships.
p221
aVAlmost overnight,
p222
aVthe proportion of men in the NBA
p223
aVwho are at least seven feet tall doubled
p224
aVto 10 percent.
p225
aVToday, one in 10 men in the NBA
p226
aVis at least seven feet tall,
p227
aVbut a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare
p228
aVin the general population \u2014
p229
aVso rare that if you know an American man
p230
aVbetween the ages of 20 and 40
p231
aVwho is at least seven feet tall,
p232
aVthere's a 17 percent chance
p233
aVhe's in the NBA right now.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVThat is, find six honest seven footers,
p236
aVone is in the NBA right now.
p237
aVAnd that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique.
p238
aVThis is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,"
p239
aVthe ideal proportions,
p240
aVwith arm span equal to height.
p241
aVMy arm span is exactly equal to my height.
p242
aVYours is probably very nearly so.
p243
aVBut not the average NBA player.
p244
aVThe average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",
p245
aVwith arms that are seven feet long.
p246
aVNot only are NBA players ridiculously tall,
p247
aVthey are ludicrously long.
p248
aVHad Leonardo wanted to draw
p249
aVthe Vitruvian NBA Player,
p250
aVhe would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,
p251
aVnot a circle and a square.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo in sports where large size is prized,
p254
aVthe large athletes have gotten larger.
p255
aVConversely, in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage,
p256
aVthe small athletes got smaller.
p257
aVThe average elite female gymnast
p258
aVshrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average
p259
aVover the last 30 years,
p260
aVall the better for their power-to-weight ratio
p261
aVand for spinning in the air.
p262
aVAnd while the large got larger
p263
aVand the small got smaller,
p264
aVthe weird got weirder.
p265
aVThe average length of the forearm
p266
aVof a water polo player in relation
p267
aVto their total arm got longer,
p268
aVall the better for a forceful throwing whip.
p269
aVAnd as the large got larger,
p270
aVsmall got smaller, and the weird weirder.
p271
aVIn swimming, the ideal body type
p272
aVis a long torso and short legs.
p273
aVIt's like the long hull of a canoe
p274
aVfor speed over the water.
p275
aVAnd the opposite is advantageous in running.
p276
aVYou want long legs and a short torso.
p277
aVAnd this shows in athletes' bodies today.
p278
aVHere you see Michael Phelps,
p279
aVthe greatest swimmer in history,
p280
aVstanding next to Hicham El Guerrouj,
p281
aVthe world record holder in the mile.
p282
aVThese men are seven inches different in height,
p283
aVbut because of the body types
p284
aVadvantaged in their sports,
p285
aVthey wear the same length pants.
p286
aVSeven inches difference in height,
p287
aVthese men have the same length legs.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow in some cases, the search for bodies
p290
aVthat could push athletic performance forward
p291
aVended up introducing into the competitive world
p292
aVpopulations of people that weren't previously competing at all,
p293
aVlike Kenyan distance runners.
p294
aVWe think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.
p295
aVKenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe
p296
aVas being great marathoners.
p297
aVThe Kalenjin make up just 12 percent
p298
aVof the Kenyan population
p299
aVbut the vast majority of elite runners.
p300
aVAnd they happen, on average,
p301
aVto have a certain unique physiology:
p302
aVlegs that are very long
p303
aVand very thin at their extremity,
p304
aVand this is because they have their ancestry
p305
aVat very low latitude
p306
aVin a very hot and dry climate,
p307
aVand an evolutionary adaptation to that
p308
aVis limbs that are very long
p309
aVand very thin at the extremity
p310
aVfor cooling purposes.
p311
aVIt's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,
p312
aVto increase surface area compared to volume
p313
aVto let heat out,
p314
aVand because the leg is like a pendulum,
p315
aVthe longer and thinner it is at the extremity,
p316
aVthe more energy-efficient it is to swing.
p317
aVTo put Kalenjin running success in perspective,
p318
aVconsider that 17 American men in history
p319
aVhave run faster than two hours and 10 minutes
p320
aVin the marathon.
p321
aVThat's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.
p322
aVThirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.
p323
aV(Laughter)
p324
aVThat's from a source population the size
p325
aVof metropolitan Atlanta.
p326
aa(lp327
VStill, even changing technology
p328
aVand the changing gene pool in sports
p329
aVdon't account for all of the changes in performance.
p330
aVAthletes have a different mindset than they once did.
p331
aVHave you ever seen in a movie when someone gets
p332
aVan electrical shock
p333
aVand they're thrown across a room?
p334
aVThere's no explosion there.
p335
aVWhat's happening when that happens is that
p336
aVthe electrical impulse is causing
p337
aVall their muscle fibers to twitch at once,
p338
aVand they're throwing themselves across the room.
p339
aVThey're essentially jumping.
p340
aVThat's the power
p341
aVthat's contained in the human body.
p342
aVBut normally we can't access nearly all of it.
p343
aVOur brain acts as a limiter,
p344
aVpreventing us from accessing all of our physical resources,
p345
aVbecause we might hurt ourselves,
p346
aVtearing tendons or ligaments.
p347
aVBut the more we learn about how that limiter functions,
p348
aVthe more we learn how we can push it back
p349
aVjust a bit,
p350
aVin some cases by convincing the brain
p351
aVthat the body won't be in mortal danger
p352
aVby pushing harder.
p353
aVEndurance and ultra-endurance sports
p354
aVserve as a great example.
p355
aVUltra-endurance was once thought to be harmful
p356
aVto human health,
p357
aVbut now we realize
p358
aVthat we have all these traits
p359
aVthat are perfect for ultra-endurance:
p360
aVno body fur and a glut of sweat glands
p361
aVthat keep us cool while running;
p362
aVnarrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;
p363
aVlarge surface area of joints for shock absorption.
p364
aVWe have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,
p365
aVshort toes that are better for pushing off
p366
aVthan for grasping tree limbs,
p367
aVand when we run,
p368
aVwe can turn our torso and our shoulders
p369
aVlike this while keeping our heads straight.
p370
aVOur primate cousins can't do that.
p371
aVThey have to run like this.
p372
aVAnd we have big old butt muscles
p373
aVthat keep us upright while running.
p374
aVHave you ever looked at an ape's butt?
p375
aVThey have no buns because they don't run upright.
p376
aVAnd as athletes have realized
p377
aVthat we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,
p378
aVthey've taken on feats
p379
aVthat would have been unthinkable before,
p380
aVathletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.
p381
aVHere's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.
p382
aV(Laughter)
p383
aVWith a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.
p384
aVIt's so steep he can't even run here.
p385
aVHe's pulling up on a rope.
p386
aVThis is a vertical ascent
p387
aVof more than 8,000 feet,
p388
aVand Kílian went up and down
p389
aVin under three hours.
p390
aVAmazing.
p391
aVAnd talented though he is,
p392
aVKílian is not a physiological freak.
p393
aVNow that he has done this,
p394
aVother athletes will follow,
p395
aVjust as other athletes followed
p396
aVafter Sir Roger Bannister
p397
aVran under four minutes in the mile.
p398
aa(lp399
VChanging technology, changing genes,
p400
aVand a changing mindset.
p401
aVInnovation in sports,
p402
aVwhether that's new track surfaces
p403
aVor new swimming techniques,
p404
aVthe democratization of sport,
p405
aVthe spread to new bodies
p406
aVand to new populations around the world,
p407
aVand imagination in sport,
p408
aVan understanding of what the human body
p409
aVis truly capable of,
p410
aVhave conspired to make athletes stronger,
p411
aVfaster, bolder,
p412
aVand better than ever.
