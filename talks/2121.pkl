VSo this is Anna Hazare,
p5
aVand Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting-edge
p6
aVdigital activist in the world today.
p7
aVAnd you wouldn't know it by looking at him.
p8
aVHazare is a 77-year-old Indian  anticorruption and social justice activist.
p9
aVAnd in 2011, he was running a big campaign
p10
aVto address everyday corruption in India,
p11
aVa topic that Indian elites love to ignore.
p12
aVSo as part of this campaign,
p13
aVhe was using all of the traditional tactics
p14
aVthat a good Gandhian organizer would use.
p15
aVSo he was on a hunger strike,
p16
aVand Hazare realized through his hunger
p17
aVthat actually maybe this time,
p18
aVin the 21st century,
p19
aVa hunger strike wouldn't be enough.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo he started playing around  with mobile activism.
p22
aVSo the first thing he did  is he said to people,
p23
aV"Okay, why don't you send me
p24
aVa text message if you support
p25
aVmy campaign against corruption?"
p26
aVSo he does this, he  gives people a short code,
p27
aVand about 80,000 people do it.
p28
aVOkay, that's pretty respectable.
p29
aVBut then he decides,
p30
aV"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."
p31
aVHe says, "Why don't you leave me a missed call?"
p32
aVNow, for those of you who have lived in the global South,
p33
aVyou'll know that missed calls
p34
aVare a really critical part of global mobile culture.
p35
aVI see people nodding.
p36
aVPeople leave missed calls all the time:
p37
aVIf you're running late for a meeting
p38
aVand you just want to let them know that you're on the way,
p39
aVyou leave them a missed call.
p40
aVIf you're dating someone and  you just want to say "I miss you"
p41
aVyou leave them a missed call.
p42
aVSo a note for a dating tip here,
p43
aVin some cultures,
p44
aVif you want to please your lover,
p45
aVyou call them and hang up. (Laughter)
p46
aVSo why do people leave missed calls?
p47
aVWell, the reason of course is that
p48
aVthey're trying to avoid charges
p49
aVassociated with making calls and sending texts.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo when Hazare asked people  to leave him a missed call,
p52
aVlet's have a little guess how  many people actually did this?
p53
aVThirty-five million.
p54
aVSo this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history.
p55
aVIt's remarkable.
p56
aVAnd this reflects the extraordinary strength  of the emerging Indian middle class
p57
aVand the power that their mobile phones bring.
p58
aVBut he used that,
p59
aVHazare ended up with this massive  CSV file of mobile phone numbers,
p60
aVand he used that to deploy
p61
aVreal people power on the ground
p62
aVto get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi
p63
aVto make a national point of  everyday corruption in India.
p64
aVIt's a really striking story.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this is me when I was 12 years old.
p67
aVI hope you see the resemblance.
p68
aVAnd I was also an activist,
p69
aVand I have been an activist all my life.
p70
aVI had this really funny childhood
p71
aVwhere I traipsed around the world
p72
aVmeeting world leaders and  Noble prize winners,
p73
aVtalking about Third World debt,
p74
aVas it was then called,
p75
aVand demilitarization.
p76
aVI was a very, very serious child. (Laughter)
p77
aVAnd back then,
p78
aVin the early '90s,
p79
aVI had a very cutting-edge tech tool of my own:
p80
aVthe fax.
p81
aVAnd the fax was the  tool of my activism.
p82
aVAnd at that time, it was the best way
p83
aVto get a message to a lot of people
p84
aVall at once.
p85
aVI'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran.
p86
aVIt was the eve of the Gulf War
p87
aVand I organized a global campaign  to flood the hotel,
p88
aVthe Intercontinental in Geneva,
p89
aVwhere James Baker and Tariq Aziz
p90
aVwere meeting on the eve of the war,
p91
aVand I thought if I could  flood them with faxes,
p92
aVwe'll stop the war.
p93
aa(lp94
VWell, unsurprisingly,
p95
aVthat campaign was wholly unsuccessful.
p96
aVThere are lots of reasons for that,
p97
aVbut there's no doubt that  one sputtering fax machine
p98
aVin Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint
p99
aVin terms of the ability to  get a message to lots of people.
p100
aVAnd so, I went on to  discover some better tools.
p101
aVI cofounded Avaaz, which uses the  Internet to mobilize people
p102
aVand now has almost  40 million members,
p103
aVand I now run Purpose, which  is a home for these kinds of
p104
aVtechnology-powered movements.
p105
aVSo what's the moral of this story?
p106
aVIs the moral of this story,
p107
aVyou know what, the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone?
p108
aVThis is another story of  tech-determinism?
p109
aVWell, I would argue that there's  actually more to it than that.
p110
aVI'd argue that in the last 20 years,
p111
aVsomething more fundamental has changed
p112
aVthan just new tech.
p113
aVI would argue that there has been a fundamental shift
p114
aVin the balance of power
p115
aVin the world.
p116
aa(lp117
VYou ask any activist how  to understand the world,
p118
aVand they'll say, "Look at where the power is,
p119
aVwho has it, how it's shifting."
p120
aVAnd I think we all sense that  something big is happening.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo Henry Timms and I \u2014
p123
aVHenry's a fellow movement builder \u2014
p124
aVgot talking one day and  we started to think,
p125
aVhow can we make sense of this new world?
p126
aVHow can we describe it and give
p127
aVit a framework that makes it more useful?
p128
aVBecause we realized that many
p129
aVof the lessons that we were discovering in movements
p130
aVactually applied all over the world
p131
aVin many sectors of our society.
p132
aVSo I want to introduce you to this framework:
p133
aVOld power, meet new power.
p134
aVAnd I want to talk to you about what new power is today.
p135
aVNew power is the deployment
p136
aVof mass participation  and peer coordination \u2014
p137
aVthese are the two key elements \u2014
p138
aVto create change and shift outcomes.
p139
aVAnd we see new power all around us.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is Beppe Grillo
p142
aVhe was a populist Italian blogger
p143
aVwho, with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools,
p144
aVwon more than 25 percent of the vote
p145
aVin recent Italian elections.
p146
aVThis is Airbnb,
p147
aVwhich in just a few years
p148
aVhas radically disrupted the hotel industry
p149
aVwithout owning a single square foot of real estate.
p150
aVThis is Kickstarter,
p151
aVwhich we know has raised over a billion dollars
p152
aVfrom more than five million people.
p153
aVNow, we're familiar with all of these models.
p154
aVBut what's striking is the commonalities,
p155
aVthe structural features of  these new models
p156
aVand how they differ from old power.
p157
aa(lp158
VLet's look a little bit at this.
p159
aVOld power is held like a currency.
p160
aVNew power works like a current.
p161
aVOld power is held by a few.
p162
aVNew power isn't held by a few, it's made by many.
p163
aVOld power is all about download,
p164
aVand new power uploads.
p165
aVAnd you see a whole set of  characteristics that you can trace,
p166
aVwhether it's in media or  politics or education.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo we've talked a little bit  about what new power is.
p169
aVLet's, for a second, talk about  what new power isn't.
p170
aVNew power is not your Facebook page.
p171
aVI assure you that having a  social media strategy
p172
aVcan enable you to do just as much download
p173
aVas you used to do when you had the radio.
p174
aVJust ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,
p175
aVI assure you that his Facebook page
p176
aVhas not embraced the power of participation.
p177
aVNew power is not inherently positive.
p178
aVIn fact, this isn't an normative argument that we're making,
p179
aVthere are many good things  about new power,
p180
aVbut it can produce bad outcomes.
p181
aVMore participation, more peer coordination,
p182
aVsometimes distorts outcomes
p183
aVand there are some things,
p184
aVlike things, for example,  in the medical profession
p185
aVthat we want new power  to get nowhere near.
p186
aVAnd thirdly, new power is not the inevitable victor.
p187
aVIn fact, unsurprisingly,
p188
aVas many of these new power models get to scale,
p189
aVwhat you see is this massive pushback
p190
aVfrom the forces of old power.
p191
aVJust look at this really  interesting epic struggle
p192
aVgoing on right now between  Edward Snowden and the NSA.
p193
aVYou'll note that only one of  the two people on this slide
p194
aVis currently in exile.
p195
aVAnd so, it's not at all clear
p196
aVthat new power will be  the inevitable victor.
p197
aa(lp198
VThat said, keep one thing in mind:
p199
aVWe're at the beginning of a very steep curve.
p200
aVSo you think about some of  these new power models, right?
p201
aVThese were just like someone's
p202
aVgarage idea a few years ago,
p203
aVand now they're disrupting  entire industries.
p204
aVAnd so, what's interesting about new power,
p205
aVis the way it feeds on itself.
p206
aVOnce you have an experience of new power,
p207
aVyou tend to expect and  want more of it.
p208
aVSo let's say you've used a peer-to-peer lending platform
p209
aVlike Lending Tree or Prosper,
p210
aVthen you've figured out that you don't need the bank,
p211
aVand who wants the bank, right?
p212
aVAnd so, that experience tends  to embolden you
p213
aVit tends to make you want more participation
p214
aVacross more aspects of your life.
p215
aVAnd what this gives rise to is
p216
aVa set of values.
p217
aVWe talked about the models
p218
aVthat new power has engendered \u2014
p219
aVthe Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.
p220
aVWhat about the values?
p221
aVAnd this is an early sketch
p222
aVat what new power values look like.
p223
aa(lp224
VNew power values prize transparency above all else.
p225
aVIt's almost a religious  belief in transparency,
p226
aVa belief that if you shine  a light on something,
p227
aVit will be better.
p228
aVAnd remember that in the 20th  century, this was not at all true.
p229
aVPeople thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors
p230
aVand make comfortable agreements.
p231
aVNew power values of informal, networked governance.
p232
aVNew power folks would never  have invented the U.N. today,
p233
aVfor better or worse.
p234
aVNew power values participation,
p235
aVand new power is all about do-it-yourself.
p236
aVIn fact, what's interesting  about new power
p237
aVis that it eschews some of  the professionalization
p238
aVand specialization that was
p239
aVall the rage in the 20th century.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo what's interesting about these
p242
aVnew power values and these new power models
p243
aVis what they mean for organizations.
p244
aVSo we've spent a bit of time thinking,
p245
aVhow can we plot organizations
p246
aVon a two-by-two where, essentially,
p247
aVwe look at new power values
p248
aVand new power models
p249
aVand see where different people sit?
p250
aVWe started with a U.S. analysis,
p251
aVand let me show you  some interesting findings.
p252
aVSo the first is Apple.
p253
aVIn this framework, we actually described Apple
p254
aVas an old power company.
p255
aVThat's because the ideology,
p256
aVthe governing ideology of Apple
p257
aVis the ideology of the perfectionist
p258
aVproduct designer in Cupertino.
p259
aVIt's absolutely about that beautiful,  perfect thing descending upon us
p260
aVin perfection.
p261
aVAnd it does not value, as a  company, transparency.
p262
aVIn fact, it's very secretive.
p263
aVNow, Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world.
p264
aVSo this shows that you can
p265
aVstill pursue a successful  old power strategy.
p266
aVBut one can argue that there's  real vulnerabilites in that model.
p267
aVI think another interesting comparison
p268
aVis that of the Obama campaign
p269
aVversus the Obama presidency.
p270
aV(Applause)
p271
aVNow, I like President Obama,
p272
aVbut he ran with new  power at his back, right?
p273
aVAnd he said to people,
p274
aVwe are the ones we've been waiting for.
p275
aVAnd he used crowdfunding
p276
aVto power a campaign.
p277
aVBut when he got into office,
p278
aVhe governed like more or less  all the other presidents did.
p279
aVAnd this is a really interesting trend,
p280
aVis when new power gets powerful,
p281
aVwhat happens?
p282
aVSo this is a framework you  should look at
p283
aVand think about where your own organization
p284
aVsits on it.
p285
aVAnd think about where it should be
p286
aVin five or 10 years.
p287
aVSo what do you do if you're old power?
p288
aVWell, if you're there  thinking, in old power,
p289
aVthis won't happen to us.
p290
aVThen just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.
p291
aVLet me tell you, it's a very sad read.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut if you are old power,
p294
aVthe most important thing you  can do is to occupy yourself
p295
aVbefore others occupy you,
p296
aVbefore you are occupied.
p297
aVImagine that a group of your biggest skeptics
p298
aVare camped in the heart of your organization
p299
aVasking the toughest questions
p300
aVand they can see everything inside of your organization.
p301
aVAnd ask them, would they  like what they see
p302
aVand should our model change?
p303
aVWhat about if you're new power?
p304
aVIs new power kind of just  riding the wave to glory?
p305
aVI would argue no.
p306
aVI would argue that there are some very real challenges
p307
aVto new power in this nascent phase.
p308
aVLet's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment.
p309
aVOccupy was this incredible example  of new power,
p310
aVthe purest example of new power.
p311
aVAnd yet, it failed to consolidate.
p312
aVSo the energy that it created
p313
aVwas great for the meme phase,
p314
aVbut they were so committed to participation,
p315
aVthat they never got anything done.
p316
aVAnd in fact that model
p317
aVmeans that the challenge for new power is:
p318
aVhow do you use institutional power
p319
aVwithout being institutionalized?
p320
aa(lp321
VOne the other end of the spectra is Uber.
p322
aVUber is an amazing,
p323
aVhighly scalable new power model.
p324
aVThat network is getting denser and denser
p325
aVby the day.
p326
aVBut what's really interesting  about Uber is
p327
aVit hasn't really adopted new power values.
p328
aVThis is a real quote from  the Uber CEO recently:
p329
aVHe says, "Once we get rid of the dude  in the car" \u2014 he means drivers \u2014
p330
aV"Uber will be cheaper."
p331
aVNow, new power models live and die
p332
aVby the strength of their networks.
p333
aVBy whether the drivers and the consumers
p334
aVwho use the service actually believe in it.
p335
aVBecause they're not an exercise  of top-down perfectionism,
p336
aVthey are about the network.
p337
aVAnd so, the challenge,
p338
aVand this is why it's in no way surprising,
p339
aVis that Uber's drivers  are now unionizing.
p340
aVIt's extraordinary.
p341
aVUber's drivers are turning on Uber.
p342
aVAnd the challenge for Uber \u2014
p343
aVthis isn't an easy situation for them \u2014
p344
aVis that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture
p345
aVthat is really old power.
p346
aVThey've raised more than a billion  dollars in the capital markets.
p347
aVThose markets expect a financial return,
p348
aVand they way you get a financial return
p349
aVis by squeezing and squeezing
p350
aVyour users and your drivers
p351
aVfor more and more value
p352
aVand giving that value to your investors.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo the big question about the future  of new power, in my view, is:
p355
aVWill that old power just emerge?
p356
aVSo will new power elites just become
p357
aVold power and squeeze?
p358
aVOr will that new power base bite back?
p359
aVWill the next big Uber
p360
aVbe co-owned by Uber drivers?
p361
aVAnd I think this going  to be a very interesting
p362
aVstructural question.
p363
aa(lp364
VFinally, think about new power
p365
aVbeing more than just an
p366
aVentity that scales things
p367
aVthat make us have slightly  better consumer experiences.
p368
aVMy call to action for new power
p369
aVis to not be an island.
p370
aVWe have major structural problems in the world today
p371
aVthat could benefit enormously
p372
aVfrom the kinds of mass participation
p373
aVand peer coordination
p374
aVthat these new power players
p375
aVknow so well how to generate.
p376
aVAnd we badly need them to  turn their energies and their power
p377
aVto big, what economists might call
p378
aVpublic goods problems,
p379
aVthat are often beyond markets
p380
aVwhere investors can easily be found.
p381
aVAnd I think if we can do that,
p382
aVwe might be able to fundamentally change
p383
aVnot only human beings' sense of  their own agency and power \u2014
p384
aVbecause I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power,
p385
aVis that people feel more powerful \u2014
p386
aVbut we might also be able to change
p387
aVthe way we relate to each other
p388
aVand the way we relate to  authority and institutions.
p389
aVAnd to me, that's absolutely
p390
aVworth trying for.
p391
aVThank you very much.
