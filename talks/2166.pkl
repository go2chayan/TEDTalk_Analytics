VWhen the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about 500 years ago,
p5
aVthey obviously found this amazing tropical forest.
p6
aVAnd among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before,
p7
aVthey found one species that caught their attention very quickly.
p8
aVThis species, when you cut the bark, you find a very dark red resin
p9
aVthat was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes.
p10
aVThe indigenous people called this species pau brasil,
p11
aVand that's the reason why this land became "land of Brasil," and later on, Brazil.
p12
aVThat's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree.
p13
aVSo you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil,
p14
aVamong other reasons.
p15
aa(lp16
VForest products are all around us.
p17
aVApart from all those products,
p18
aVthe forest is very important for climate regulation.
p19
aVIn Brazil, almost 70 percent of the evaporation that makes rain
p20
aVactually comes from the forest.
p21
aVJust the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere 20 billion tons of water every day.
p22
aVThis is more than what the Amazon River, which is the largest river in the world,
p23
aVputs in the sea per day, which is 17 billion tons.
p24
aVIf we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration,
p25
aVwe would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world.
p26
aVSo it's a hell of a service for all of us.
p27
aa(lp28
VWe have in the world about four billion hectares of forests.
p29
aVThis is more or less China, U.S., Canada and Brazil all together,
p30
aVin terms of size, to have an idea.
p31
aVThree quarters of that is in the temperate zone,
p32
aVand just one quarter is in the tropics,
p33
aVbut this one quarter, one billion hectares, holds most of the biodiversity,
p34
aVand very importantly, 50 percent of the living biomass, the carbon.
p35
aVNow, we used to have six billion hectares of forest \u2014
p36
aV50 percent more than what we have \u2014 2,000 years ago.
p37
aVWe've actually lost two billion hectares in the last 2,000 years.
p38
aVBut in the last 100 years, we lost half of that.
p39
aVThat was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests
p40
aVto deforestation of tropical forests.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo think of this: In 100 years,
p43
aVwe lost the same amount of forest in the tropics
p44
aVthat we lost in 2,000 years in temperate forests.
p45
aVThat's the speed of the destruction that we are having.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle.
p48
aVWe have the second largest forest in the world, just after Russia.
p49
aVIt means 12 percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil,
p50
aVmost of that in the Amazon.
p51
aVIt's the largest piece of forest we have. It's a very big, large area.
p52
aVYou can see that you could fit many of the European countries there.
p53
aVWe still have 80 percent of the forest cover.
p54
aVThat's the good news.
p55
aVBut we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.
p56
aVSo if you go with that speed,
p57
aVvery soon, we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon
p58
aVthat regulates our climate.
p59
aa(lp60
VDeforestation was growing fast and accelerating
p61
aVat the end of the '90s and the beginning of the 2000s.
p62
aV(Chainsaw sound)
p63
aV(Sound of falling tree)
p64
aVTwenty-seven thousand square kilometers in one year.
p65
aVThis is 2.7 million hectares.
p66
aVIt's almost like half of Costa Rica every year.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo at this moment \u2014 this is 2003, 2004 \u2014
p69
aVI happened to be coming to work in the government.
p70
aVAnd together with other teammates in the National Forest Department,
p71
aVwe were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation,
p72
aVand make a plan to combat that at a national level,
p73
aVinvolving the local governments, the civil society,
p74
aVbusiness, local communities,
p75
aVin an effort that could tackle those causes.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo we came up with this plan with 144 actions in different areas.
p78
aVNow I will go through all of them one by one \u2014
p79
aVno, just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years.
p80
aVSo the first thing, we set up a system with the national space agency
p81
aVthat could actually see where deforestation is happening,
p82
aValmost in real time.
p83
aVSo now in Brazil,  we have this system, DETER,
p84
aVwhere every month, or every two months,
p85
aVwe get information on where deforestation is happening
p86
aVso we can actually act when it's happening.
p87
aVAnd all the information is fully transparent
p88
aVso others can replicate that in independent systems.
p89
aVThis allows us, among other things,
p90
aVto apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken.
p91
aVPart of that we saw and sell, and all the revenue becomes a fund
p92
aVthat now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund.
p93
aVThis also allows us to make a big operation
p94
aVto seize corruption and illegal activities
p95
aVthat ended up having 700 people in prison, including a lot of public servants.
p96
aVThen we made the connection that areas that have been doing
p97
aVillegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance.
p98
aVSo we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users.
p99
aVSo supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, and so on
p100
aVthat buy products from illegal clear-cut areas,
p101
aVthey also can be liable for the deforestation.
p102
aVSo making all these connections to help to push the problem down.
p103
aVAnd also we work a lot on land tenure issues.
p104
aVIt's very important for conflicts.
p105
aVFifty million hectares of protected areas were created,
p106
aVwhich is an area the size of Spain.
p107
aVAnd of those, eight million were indigenous lands.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow we start to see results.
p110
aVSo in the last 10 years,
p111
aVdeforestation came down in Brazil 75 percent.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo if we compare it with the average deforestation
p116
aVthat we had in the last decade,
p117
aVwe saved 8.7 million hectares, which is the size of Austria.
p118
aVBut more importantly, it avoided the emission
p119
aVof three billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere.
p120
aVThis is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
p121
aVuntil today, as a positive action.
p122
aVOne may think that when you do these kinds of actions
p123
aVto decrease, to push down deforestation,
p124
aVyou will have an economic impact
p125
aVbecause you will not have economic activity or something like that.
p126
aVBut it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite.
p127
aVIn fact, in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation,
p128
aVthe economy grew, on average, double from the previous decade,
p129
aVwhen deforestation was actually going up.
p130
aVSo it's a good lesson for us.
p131
aVMaybe this is completely disconnected,
p132
aVas we just learned by having deforestation come down.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow this is all good news, and it's quite an achievement,
p135
aVand we obviously should be very proud about that.
p136
aVBut it's not even close to sufficient.
p137
aVIn fact, if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,
p138
aVthat was over half a million hectares,
p139
aVwhich means that every minute,
p140
aVan area the size of two soccer fields
p141
aVis being cut in the Amazon last year, just last year.
p142
aVIf we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil,
p143
aVwe are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world.
p144
aVIt's more or less like we are forest heroes,
p145
aVbut still deforestation champions.
p146
aVSo we can't be satisfied, not even close to satisfied.
p147
aVSo the next step, I think,
p148
aVis to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil
p149
aVand to have that as a goal for 2020.
p150
aVThat's our next step.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow I've always been interested in the relationship
p153
aVbetween climate change and forests.
p154
aVFirst, because 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation,
p155
aVso it's a big part of the problem.
p156
aVBut also, forests can be a big part of the solution
p157
aVsince that's the best way we know to sink, capture and store carbon.
p158
aVNow, there is another relationship of climate and forests
p159
aVthat really stuck me in 2008 and made me change my career
p160
aVfrom forests to working with climate change.
p161
aVI went to visit Canada, in British Columbia,
p162
aVtogether with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries
p163
aVthat we have a kind of alliance of them, like Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.
p164
aVAnd when we were there we learned about this pine beetle
p165
aVthat is literally eating the forests in Canada.
p166
aVWhat we see here, those brown trees, these are really dead trees.
p167
aVThey are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle.
p168
aVWhat happens is that this beetle
p169
aVis controlled by the cold weather in the winter.
p170
aVFor many years now, they don't have the sufficient cold weather
p171
aVto actually control the population of this beetle.
p172
aVAnd it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees.
p173
aVSo I came back with this notion that the forest is actually
p174
aVone of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo I was thinking,
p177
aVif I succeed in working with all my colleagues
p178
aVto actually help to stop deforestation,
p179
aVmaybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change
p180
aVby floods, heat, fires and so on.
p181
aVSo I decided to leave the forest service
p182
aVand start to work directly on climate change,
p183
aVfind a way to think and understand the challenge, and go from there.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward.
p186
aVThe goal is very clear.
p187
aVWe want to limit the increase of the average temperature
p188
aVof the planet to two degrees.
p189
aVThere are several reasons for that.
p190
aVI will not get into that now.
p191
aVBut in order to get to this limit of two degrees,
p192
aVwhich is possible for us to survive,
p193
aVthe IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
p194
aVdefines that we have a budget of emissions of 1,000 billion tons of CO2
p195
aVfrom now until the end of the century.
p196
aVSo if we divide this by the number of years,
p197
aVwhat we have is an average budget of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.
p198
aVNow what is one ton of CO2?
p199
aVIt's more or less what one small car, running 20 kilometers a day,
p200
aVwill emit in one year.
p201
aVOr it's one flight, one way,
p202
aVfrom São Paulo to Johannesburg or to London, one way.
p203
aVTwo ways, two tons.
p204
aVSo 11 billion tons is twice that.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow the emissions today are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.
p207
aVIt's growing and maybe it will be 61 by 2020.
p208
aVNow we need to go down to 10 by 2050.
p209
aVAnd while this happens,
p210
aVthe population will grow from seven to nine billion people,
p211
aVthe economy will grow from 60 trillion dollars in 2010
p212
aVto 200 trillion dollars.
p213
aVAnd so what we need to do is to be much more efficient
p214
aVin a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita
p215
aVper person, per year, into something like one.
p216
aVYou have to choose. You take the airplane or you have a car.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo the question is, can we make it?
p219
aVAnd that's the exactly the same question
p220
aVI got when I was developing a plan to combat deforestation.
p221
aVIt's such a big problem, so complex. Can we really do it?
p222
aVI think so. Think of this:
p223
aVDeforestation means 60 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions
p224
aVin Brazil in the last decade.
p225
aVNow it's a little bit less than 30 percent.
p226
aVIn the world, 60 percent is energy.
p227
aVSo if we can tackle directly the energy,
p228
aVthe same way we could tackle deforestation,
p229
aVmaybe we can have a chance.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo there are five things that I think we should do.
p232
aVFirst, we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions.
p233
aVWe don't need to clear-cut all the forests to actually get more jobs
p234
aVand agriculture and have more economy.
p235
aVThat's what we proved when we decreased deforestation
p236
aVand the economy continued to grow.
p237
aVSame thing could happen in the energy sector.
p238
aVSecond, we have to move the incentives to the right place.
p239
aVToday, 500 billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels.
p240
aVWhy don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy?
p241
aVThird, we need to measure and make it transparent
p242
aVwhere, when and who is emitting greenhouse gases
p243
aVso we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities.
p244
aVFourth, we need to leapfrog the routes of development,
p245
aVwhich means, you don't need to go to the landline telephone
p246
aVbefore you get to the mobile phones.
p247
aVSame way we don't need to go to fossil fuels
p248
aVto the one billion people who don't have access to energy
p249
aVbefore we get to the clean energy.
p250
aVAnd fifth and last,
p251
aVwe need to share responsibility between governments,
p252
aVbusiness and civil society.
p253
aVThere is work to do for everybody, and we need to have everybody on board.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo to finalize,
p256
aVI think the future is not like a fate
p257
aVthat you have to just go as business as usual goes.
p258
aVWe need to have the courage to actually change the route,
p259
aVinvest in something new,
p260
aVthink that we can actually change the route.
p261
aVI think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil,
p262
aVand I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.
