VOne of the first patients I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol,
p5
aVa beautiful month-old baby
p6
aVwho was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection.
p7
aVUntil then, I had never seen a patient worsen so fast.
p8
aVIn just two days she was connected to a respirator
p9
aVand on the third day she died.
p10
aVSol had whooping cough.
p11
aVAfter discussing the case in the room and after a quite distressing catharsis,
p12
aVI remember my chief resident said to me,
p13
aV"Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face.
p14
aVAnd now comes the hardest part:
p15
aVWe have to go talk to her parents."
p16
aVAt that time, a thousand questions came to mind,
p17
aVfrom, "How could a one-month-old baby be so unfortunate?"
p18
aVto, "Could we have done something about it?"
p19
aa(lp20
VBefore vaccines existed,
p21
aVmany infectious diseases killed millions of people per year.
p22
aVDuring the 1918 flu pandemic
p23
aV50 million people died.
p24
aVThat's greater than Argentina's current population.
p25
aVPerhaps, the older ones among you remember the polio epidemic
p26
aVthat occurred in Argentina in 1956.
p27
aVAt that time, there was no vaccine available against polio.
p28
aVPeople didn't know what to do. They were going crazy.
p29
aVThey would go painting trees with caustic lime.
p30
aVThey'd put little bags of camphor
p31
aVin their children's underwear, as if that could do something.
p32
aVDuring the polio epidemic, thousands of people died.
p33
aVAnd thousands of people were left with very significant neurological damage.
p34
aVI know this because I read about it,
p35
aVbecause thanks to vaccines, my generation was lucky
p36
aVto not live through an epidemic as terrible as this.
p37
aa(lp38
VVaccines are one of the great successes of the 20th century's public health.
p39
aVAfter potable water,
p40
aVthey are the interventions that have most reduced mortality,
p41
aVeven more than antibiotics.
p42
aVVaccines eradicated terrible diseases such as smallpox from the planet
p43
aVand succeeded in significantly reducing mortality
p44
aVdue to other diseases such as measles,
p45
aVwhooping cough, polio and many more.
p46
aa(lp47
VAll these diseases are considered vaccine-preventable diseases.
p48
aVWhat does this mean?
p49
aVThat they are potentially preventable,
p50
aVbut in order to be so, something must be done.
p51
aVYou need to get vaccinated.
p52
aVI imagine that most, if not all of us here today,
p53
aVreceived a vaccine at some point in our life.
p54
aVNow, I'm not so sure that many of us know
p55
aVwhich vaccines or boosters we should receive after adolescence.
p56
aVHave you ever wondered who we are protecting
p57
aVwhen we vaccinate?
p58
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p59
aVIs there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves?
p60
aa(lp61
VLet me show you something.
p62
aVImagine for a moment
p63
aVthat we are in a city
p64
aVthat has never had a case of a particular disease,
p65
aVsuch as the measles.
p66
aVThis would mean that no one in the city has ever had contact with the disease.
p67
aVNo one has natural defenses against, nor been vaccinated against measles.
p68
aVIf one day, a person sick with the measles appears in this city
p69
aVthe disease won't find much resistance
p70
aVand will begin spreading from person to person,
p71
aVand in no time it will disseminate throughout the community.
p72
aVAfter a certain time
p73
aVa big part of the population will be ill.
p74
aVThis happened when there were no vaccines.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, imagine the complete opposite case.
p77
aVWe are in a city
p78
aVwhere more than 90 percent of the population
p79
aVhas defenses against the measles, which means
p80
aVthat they either had the disease, survived, and developed natural defenses;
p81
aVor that they had been immunized against measles.
p82
aVIf one day,
p83
aVa person sick with the measles appears in this city,
p84
aVthe disease will find much more resistance
p85
aVand won't be transmitted that much from person to person.
p86
aVThe spread will probably remain contained
p87
aVand a measles outbreak won't happen.
p88
aa(lp89
VI would like you to pay attention to something.
p90
aVPeople who are vaccinated
p91
aVare not only protecting themselves,
p92
aVbut by blocking the dissemination of the disease
p93
aVwithin the community,
p94
aVthey are indirectly protecting the people in this community
p95
aVwho are not vaccinated.
p96
aVThey create a kind of protective shield
p97
aVwhich prevents them from coming in contact with the disease,
p98
aVso that these people are protected.
p99
aVThis indirect protection
p100
aVthat the unvaccinated people within a community receive
p101
aVsimply by being surrounded by vaccinated people,
p102
aVis called herd immunity.
p103
aa(lp104
VMany people in the community
p105
aVdepend almost exclusively on this herd immunity
p106
aVto be protected against disease.
p107
aVThe unvaccinated people you see in infographics are not just hypothetical.
p108
aVThose people are our nieces and nephews, our children,
p109
aVwho may be too young to receive their first shots.
p110
aVThey are our parents, our siblings,
p111
aVour acquaintances,
p112
aVwho may have a disease,
p113
aVor take medication that lowers their defenses.
p114
aVThere are also people who are allergic to a particular vaccine.
p115
aVThey could even be among us,
p116
aVany of us who got vaccinated,
p117
aVbut the vaccine didn't produce the expected effect,
p118
aVbecause not all vaccines are always 100 percent effective.
p119
aVAll these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity
p120
aVto be protected against diseases.
p121
aa(lp122
VTo achieve this effect of herd immunity,
p123
aVit is necessary that a large percentage of the population be vaccinated.
p124
aVThis percentage is called the threshold.
p125
aVThe threshold depends on many variables:
p126
aVIt depends on the germ's characteristics,
p127
aVand those of the immune response that the vaccine generates.
p128
aVBut they all have something in common.
p129
aVIf the percentage of the population in a vaccinated community
p130
aVis below this threshold number,
p131
aVthe disease will begin to spread more freely
p132
aVand may generate an outbreak of this disease within the community.
p133
aVEven diseases which were  at some point controlled may reappear.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is not just a theory.
p136
aVThis has happened, and is still happening.
p137
aVIn 1998, a British researcher published an article
p138
aVin one of the most important medical journals,
p139
aVsaying that the MMR vaccine,
p140
aVwhich is given for measles, mumps and rubella,
p141
aVwas associated with autism.
p142
aVThis generated an immediate impact.
p143
aVPeople began to stop getting vaccinated, and stopped vaccinating their children.
p144
aVAnd what happened?
p145
aVThe number of people vaccinated,
p146
aVin many communities around the world, fell below this threshold.
p147
aVAnd there were outbreaks of measles in many cities in the world \u2014
p148
aVin the U.S., in Europe.
p149
aVMany people got sick.
p150
aVPeople died of measles.
p151
aVWhat happened?
p152
aa(lp153
VThis article also generated a huge stir within the medical community.
p154
aVDozens of researchers began to assess if this was actually true.
p155
aVNot only could no one find
p156
aVa causal association between MMR and autism at the population level,
p157
aVbut it was also found that this article had incorrect claims.
p158
aVEven more, it was fraudulent.
p159
aVIt was fraudulent.
p160
aVIn fact, the journal publicly retracted the article in 2010.
p161
aVOne of the main concerns and excuses for not getting vaccinated
p162
aVare the adverse effects.
p163
aa(lp164
VVaccines, like other drugs, can have potential adverse effects.
p165
aVMost are mild and temporary.
p166
aVBut the benefits are always greater than possible complications.
p167
aVWhen we are ill, we want to heal fast.
p168
aVMany of us who are here
p169
aVtake antibiotics when we have an infection,
p170
aVwe take anti-hypertensives when we have high blood pressure,
p171
aVwe take cardiac medications.
p172
aVWhy? Because we are sick and we want to heal fast.
p173
aVAnd we don't question it much.
p174
aVWhy is it so difficult to think of preventing diseases,
p175
aVby taking care of ourselves when we are healthy?
p176
aVWe take care of ourselves a lot when affected by an illness,
p177
aVor in situations of imminent danger.
p178
aa(lp179
VI imagine most of us here,
p180
aVremember the influenza-A pandemic
p181
aVwhich broke out in 2009 in Argentina and worldwide.
p182
aVWhen the first cases began to come to light,
p183
aVwe, here in Argentina, were entering the winter season.
p184
aVWe knew absolutely nothing.
p185
aVEverything was a mess.
p186
aVPeople wore masks on the street, ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel.
p187
aVPeople would line up in pharmacies to get a vaccine,
p188
aVwithout even knowing if it was the right vaccine
p189
aVthat would protect them against this new virus.
p190
aVWe knew absolutely nothing.
p191
aVAt that time, in addition to doing my fellowship at the Infant Foundation,
p192
aVI worked as a home pediatrician for a prepaid medicine company.
p193
aVI remember that I started my shift at 8 a.m.,
p194
aVand by 8, I already had a list of 50 scheduled visits.
p195
aVIt was chaos; people didn't know what to do.
p196
aVI remember the types of patients that I was examining.
p197
aVThe patients were a little older than what we were used to seeing in winter,
p198
aVwith longer fevers.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd I mentioned that to my fellowship mentor,
p201
aVand he, for his part, had heard the same from a colleague,
p202
aVabout the large number of pregnant women
p203
aVand young adults
p204
aVbeing hospitalized in intensive care,
p205
aVwith hard-to-manage clinical profiles.
p206
aVAt that time, we set out to understand what was happening.
p207
aVFirst thing Monday morning, we took the car
p208
aVand went to a hospital in Buenos Aires Province,
p209
aVthat served as a referral hospital for cases of the new influenza virus.
p210
aVWe arrived at the hospital; it was crowded.
p211
aVAll health staff were dressed in NASA-like bio-safety suits.
p212
aVWe all had face masks in our pockets.
p213
aVI, being a hypochondriac, didn't breathe for two hours.
p214
aVBut we could see what was happening.
p215
aVImmediately, we started reaching out to pediatricians
p216
aVfrom six hospitals in the city and in Buenos Aires Province.
p217
aVOur main goal was to find out
p218
aVhow this new virus behaved in contact with our children,
p219
aVin the shortest time possible.
p220
aVA marathon work.
p221
aVIn less than three months,
p222
aVwe could see what effect this new H1N1 virus had
p223
aVon the 251 children hospitalized by this virus.
p224
aVWe could see which children got more seriously ill:
p225
aVchildren under four, especially those less than one year old;
p226
aVpatients with neurological diseases;
p227
aVand young children with chronic pulmonary diseases.
p228
aVIdentifying these at-risk groups was important
p229
aVto include them as priority groups
p230
aVin the recommendations for getting the influenza vaccine,
p231
aVnot only here in Argentina,
p232
aVbut also in other countries which the pandemic not yet reached.
p233
aa(lp234
VA year later,
p235
aVwhen a vaccine against the pandemic H1N1 virus became available,
p236
aVwe wanted to see what happened.
p237
aVAfter a huge vaccination campaign
p238
aVaimed at protecting at-risk groups,
p239
aVthese hospitals, with 93 percent of the at-risk groups vaccinated,
p240
aVhad not hospitalized a single patient
p241
aVfor the pandemic H1N1 virus.
p242
aV(Applause)
p243
aVIn 2009: 251.
p244
aVIn 2010: zero.
p245
aa(lp246
VVaccination is an act of individual responsibility,
p247
aVbut it has a huge collective impact.
p248
aVIf I get vaccinated, not only am I protecting myself,
p249
aVbut I am also protecting others.
p250
aVSol had whooping cough.
p251
aVSol was very young,
p252
aVand she hadn't yet received her first vaccine against whooping cough.
p253
aVI still wonder what would have happened
p254
aVif everyone around Sol had been vaccinated.
p255
