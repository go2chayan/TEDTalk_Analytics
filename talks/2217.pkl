VYou're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade.
p5
aVObviously, that's changed,
p6
aVbut only recently.
p7
aa(lp8
VIt was several months ago
p9
aVthat I gave my very first major public talk
p10
aVat the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:
p11
aV1,500 brilliant people, all under the age of 30.
p12
aVThat meant that in 1998,
p13
aVthe oldest among the group were only 14,
p14
aVand the youngest, just four.
p15
aVI joked with them that some might only have heard of me
p16
aVfrom rap songs.
p17
aVYes, I'm in rap songs.
p18
aVAlmost 40 rap songs. (Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VBut the night of my speech, a surprising thing happened.
p21
aVAt the age of 41, I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy.
p22
aVI know, right?
p23
aVHe was charming and I was flattered,
p24
aVand I declined.
p25
aVYou know what his unsuccessful pickup line was?
p26
aVHe could make me feel 22 again.
p27
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p28
aVI realized later that night, I'm probably the only person over 40
p29
aVwho does not want to be 22 again.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aV(Applause)
p32
aa(lp33
VAt the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss,
p34
aVand at the age of 24,
p35
aVI learned the devastating consequences.
p36
aa(lp37
VCan I see a show of hands of anyone here
p38
aVwho didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22?
p39
aVYep. That's what I thought.
p40
aVSo like me, at 22, a few of you may have also taken wrong turns
p41
aVand fallen in love with the wrong person,
p42
aVmaybe even your boss.
p43
aVUnlike me, though, your boss
p44
aVprobably wasn't the president of the United States of America.
p45
aVOf course, life is full of surprises.
p46
aa(lp47
VNot a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake,
p48
aVand I regret that mistake deeply.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance,
p51
aVI was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom
p52
aVlike we had never seen before.
p53
aVRemember, just a few years earlier,
p54
aVnews was consumed from just three places:
p55
aVreading a newspaper or magazine,
p56
aVlistening to the radio,
p57
aVor watching television.
p58
aVThat was it.
p59
aVBut that wasn't my fate.
p60
aVInstead, this scandal was brought to you
p61
aVby the digital revolution.
p62
aVThat meant we could access all the information we wanted,
p63
aVwhen we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,
p64
aVand when the story broke in January 1998,
p65
aVit broke online.
p66
aVIt was the first time the traditional news
p67
aVwas usurped by the Internet for a major news story,
p68
aVa click that reverberated around the world.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhat that meant for me personally
p71
aVwas that overnight I went from being a completely private figure
p72
aVto a publicly humiliated one worldwide.
p73
aVI was patient zero of losing a personal reputation
p74
aVon a global scale almost instantaneously.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis rush to judgment, enabled by technology,
p77
aVled to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.
p78
aVGranted, it was before social media,
p79
aVbut people could still comment online,
p80
aVemail stories, and, of course, email cruel jokes.
p81
aVNews sources plastered photos of me all over
p82
aVto sell newspapers, banner ads online,
p83
aVand to keep people tuned to the TV.
p84
aVDo you recall a particular image of me,
p85
aVsay, wearing a beret?
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, I admit I made mistakes,
p88
aVespecially wearing that beret.
p89
aVBut the attention and judgment that I received, not the story,
p90
aVbut that I personally received, was unprecedented.
p91
aVI was branded as a tramp,
p92
aVtart, slut, whore, bimbo,
p93
aVand, of course, that woman.
p94
aVI was seen by many
p95
aVbut actually known by few.
p96
aVAnd I get it: it was easy to forget
p97
aVthat that woman was dimensional,
p98
aVhad a soul, and was once unbroken.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhen this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it.
p101
aVNow we call it cyberbullying and online harassment.
p102
aVToday, I want to share some of my experience with you,
p103
aVtalk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations,
p104
aVand how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results
p105
aVin less suffering for others.
p106
aa(lp107
VIn 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity.
p108
aVI lost almost everything,
p109
aVand I almost lost my life.
p110
aa(lp111
VLet me paint a picture for you.
p112
aVIt is September of 1998.
p113
aVI'm sitting in a windowless office room
p114
aVinside the Office of the Independent Counsel
p115
aVunderneath humming fluorescent lights.
p116
aVI'm listening to the sound of my voice,
p117
aVmy voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls
p118
aVthat a supposed friend had made the year before.
p119
aVI'm here because I've been legally required
p120
aVto personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation.
p121
aVFor the past eight months, the mysterious content of these tapes
p122
aVhas hung like the Sword of Damocles over my head.
p123
aVI mean, who can remember what they said a year ago?
p124
aVScared and mortified, I listen,
p125
aVlisten as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;
p126
aVlisten as I confess my love for the president,
p127
aVand, of course, my heartbreak;
p128
aVlisten to my sometimes catty, sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self
p129
aVbeing cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;
p130
aVlisten, deeply, deeply ashamed,
p131
aVto the worst version of myself,
p132
aVa self I don't even recognize.
p133
aa(lp134
VA few days later, the Starr Report is released to Congress,
p135
aVand all of those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it.
p136
aVThat people can read the transcripts is horrific enough,
p137
aVbut a few weeks later,
p138
aVthe audio tapes are aired on TV,
p139
aVand significant portions made available online.
p140
aVThe public humiliation was excruciating.
p141
aVLife was almost unbearable.
p142
aa(lp143
VThis was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998,
p144
aVand by this, I mean the stealing of people's private words, actions,
p145
aVconversations or photos,
p146
aVand then making them public \u2014
p147
aVpublic without consent,
p148
aVpublic without context,
p149
aVand public without compassion.
p150
aa(lp151
VFast forward 12 years to 2010,
p152
aVand now social media has been born.
p153
aVThe landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine,
p154
aVwhether or not someone actually make a mistake,
p155
aVand now it's for both public and private people.
p156
aVThe consequences for some have become dire, very dire.
p157
aa(lp158
VI was on the phone with my mom
p159
aVin September of 2010,
p160
aVand we were talking about the news
p161
aVof a young college freshman from Rutgers University
p162
aVnamed Tyler Clementi.
p163
aVSweet, sensitive, creative Tyler
p164
aVwas secretly webcammed by his roommate
p165
aVwhile being intimate with another man.
p166
aVWhen the online world learned of this incident,
p167
aVthe ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.
p168
aVA few days later,
p169
aVTyler jumped from  the George Washington Bridge
p170
aVto his death.
p171
aVHe was 18.
p172
aa(lp173
VMy mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family,
p174
aVand she was gutted with pain
p175
aVin a way that I just couldn't quite understand,
p176
aVand then eventually I realized
p177
aVshe was reliving 1998,
p178
aVreliving a time when she sat by my bed every night,
p179
aVreliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open,
p180
aVand reliving a time when both of my parents feared
p181
aVthat I would be humiliated to death,
p182
aVliterally.
p183
aa(lp184
VToday, too many parents
p185
aVhaven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones.
p186
aVToo many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation
p187
aVafter it was too late.
p188
aVTyler's tragic, senseless death was a turning point for me.
p189
aVIt served to recontextualize my experiences,
p190
aVand I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me
p191
aVand see something different.
p192
aVIn 1998, we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology
p193
aVcalled the Internet would take us.
p194
aVSince then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways,
p195
aVjoining lost siblings,
p196
aVsaving lives, launching revolutions,
p197
aVbut the darkness, cyberbullying, and slut-shaming that I experienced
p198
aVhad mushroomed.
p199
aVEvery day online, people, especially young people
p200
aVwho are not developmentally equipped to handle this,
p201
aVare so abused and humiliated
p202
aVthat they can't imagine living to the next day,
p203
aVand some, tragically, don't,
p204
aVand there's nothing virtual about that.
p205
aVChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues,
p206
aVreleased a staggering statistic late last year:
p207
aVFrom 2012 to 2013,
p208
aVthere was an 87 percent increase
p209
aVin calls and emails related to cyberbullying.
p210
aVA meta-analysis done out of the Netherlands
p211
aVshowed that for the first time,
p212
aVcyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations
p213
aVmore significantly than offline bullying.
p214
aVAnd you know what shocked me, although it shouldn't have,
p215
aVwas other research last year that determined humiliation
p216
aVwas a more intensely felt emotion
p217
aVthan either happiness or even anger.
p218
aa(lp219
VCruelty to others is nothing new,
p220
aVbut online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified,
p221
aVuncontained, and permanently accessible.
p222
aVThe echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family, village,
p223
aVschool or community,
p224
aVbut now it's the online community too.
p225
aVMillions of people, often anonymously,
p226
aVcan stab you with their words, and that's a lot of pain,
p227
aVand there are no perimeters around how many people
p228
aVcan publicly observe you
p229
aVand put you in a public stockade.
p230
aVThere is a very personal price
p231
aVto public humiliation,
p232
aVand the growth of the Internet has jacked up that price.
p233
aa(lp234
VFor nearly two decades now,
p235
aVwe have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation
p236
aVin our cultural soil, both on- and offline.
p237
aVGossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics,
p238
aVnews outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame.
p239
aVIt's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online
p240
aVwhich lends itself to trolling, invasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.
p241
aVThis shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls
p242
aVa culture of humiliation.
p243
aVConsider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone.
p244
aVSnapchat, the service which is used mainly by younger generations
p245
aVand claims that its messages only have the lifespan
p246
aVof a few seconds.
p247
aVYou can imagine the range of content that that gets.
p248
aVA third-party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan
p249
aVof the messages was hacked,
p250
aVand 100,000 personal conversations, photos, and videos were leaked online
p251
aVto now have a lifespan of forever.
p252
aVJennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked,
p253
aVand private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the Internet
p254
aVwithout their permission.
p255
aVOne gossip website had over five million hits
p256
aVfor this one story.
p257
aVAnd what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?
p258
aVThe documents which received the most attention
p259
aVwere private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut in this culture of humiliation,
p262
aVthere is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming.
p263
aVThe price does not measure the cost to the victim,
p264
aVwhich Tyler and too many others,
p265
aVnotably women, minorities,
p266
aVand members of the LGBTQ community have paid,
p267
aVbut the price measures the profit of those who prey on them.
p268
aVThis invasion of others is a raw material,
p269
aVefficiently and ruthlessly mined, packaged and sold at a profit.
p270
aVA marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity
p271
aVand shame is an industry.
p272
aVHow is the money made?
p273
aVClicks.
p274
aVThe more shame, the more clicks.
p275
aVThe more clicks, the more advertising dollars.
p276
aVWe're in a dangerous cycle.
p277
aVThe more we click on this kind of gossip,
p278
aVthe more numb we get to the human lives behind it,
p279
aVand the more numb we get, the more we click.
p280
aVAll the while, someone is making money
p281
aVoff of the back  of someone else's suffering.
p282
aVWith every click, we make a choice.
p283
aVThe more we saturate our culture with public shaming,
p284
aVthe more accepted it is,
p285
aVthe more we will see behavior like cyberbullying,
p286
aVtrolling, some forms of hacking,
p287
aVand online harassment.
p288
aVWhy? Because they all have humiliation at their cores.
p289
aVThis behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created.
p290
aVJust think about it.
p291
aa(lp292
VChanging behavior begins with evolving beliefs.
p293
aVWe've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia,
p294
aVand plenty of other biases, today and in the past.
p295
aVAs we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage,
p296
aVmore people have been offered equal freedoms.
p297
aVWhen we began valuing sustainability,
p298
aVmore people began to recycle.
p299
aVSo as far as our culture of humiliation goes,
p300
aVwhat we need is a cultural revolution.
p301
aVPublic shaming as a blood sport has to stop,
p302
aVand it's time for an intervention on the Internet and in our culture.
p303
aa(lp304
VThe shift begins with something simple, but it's not easy.
p305
aVWe need to return to a long-held value of compassion \u2014 compassion and empathy.
p306
aVOnline, we've got a compassion deficit,
p307
aVan empathy crisis.
p308
aa(lp309
VResearcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,
p310
aV"Shame can't survive empathy."
p311
aVShame cannot survive empathy.
p312
aVI've seen some very dark days in my life,
p313
aVand it was the compassion and empathy from my family, friends, professionals,
p314
aVand sometimes even strangers that saved me.
p315
aVEven empathy from one person can make a difference.
p316
aVThe theory of minority influence,
p317
aVproposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici,
p318
aVsays that even in small numbers,
p319
aVwhen there's consistency over time,
p320
aVchange can happen.
p321
aVIn the online world, we can foster minority influence
p322
aVby becoming upstanders.
p323
aVTo become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy,
p324
aVwe can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation.
p325
aVTrust me, compassionate comments help abate the negativity.
p326
aVWe can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations
p327
aVthat deal with these kinds of issues,
p328
aVlike the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the U.S.,
p329
aVIn the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,
p330
aVand in Australia, there's Project Rockit.
p331
aa(lp332
VWe talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression,
p333
aVbut we need to talk more about
p334
aVour responsibility to freedom of expression.
p335
aVWe all want to be heard,
p336
aVbut let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention
p337
aVand speaking up for attention.
p338
aVThe Internet is  the superhighway for the id,
p339
aVbut online, showing empathy to others
p340
aVbenefits us all and helps create a safer and better world.
p341
aVWe need to communicate online with compassion,
p342
aVconsume news with compassion,
p343
aVand click with compassion.
p344
aVJust imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline.
p345
aVI'd like to end on a personal note.
p346
aVIn the past nine months,
p347
aVthe question I've been  asked the most is why.
p348
aVWhy now? Why was I  sticking my head above the parapet?
p349
aVYou can read between the lines in those questions,
p350
aVand the answer has nothing to do with politics.
p351
aVThe top note answer was and is because it's time:
p352
aVtime to stop tip-toeing around my past;
p353
aVtime to stop living a life of opprobrium;
p354
aVand time to take back my narrative.
p355
aa(lp356
VIt's also not just about saving myself.
p357
aVAnyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation
p358
aVneeds to know one thing:
p359
aVYou can survive it.
p360
aVI know it's hard.
p361
aVIt may not be painless, quick or easy,
p362
aVbut you can insist on a different ending to your story.
p363
aVHave compassion for yourself.
p364
aVWe all deserve compassion,
p365
aVand to live both online and off in a more compassionate world.
p366
aa(lp367
VThank you for listening.
