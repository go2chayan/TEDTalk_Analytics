VI'd like to have you look at this pencil.
p5
aVIt's a thing. It's a legal thing.
p6
aVAnd so are books you might have or the cars you own.
p7
aVThey're all legal things.
p8
aVThe great apes that you'll see behind me,
p9
aVthey too are legal things.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, I can do that to a legal thing.
p12
aVI can do whatever I want to my book or my car.
p13
aVThese great apes, you'll see.
p14
aVThe photographs are taken by a man named James Mollison
p15
aVwho wrote a book called "James & Other Apes."
p16
aVAnd he tells in his book how every single one them,
p17
aValmost every one of them, is an orphan
p18
aVwho saw his mother and father die before his eyes.
p19
aVThey're legal things.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo for centuries, there's been a great legal wall
p22
aVthat separates legal things from legal persons.
p23
aVOn one hand, legal things are invisible to judges.
p24
aVThey don't count in law.
p25
aVThey don't have any legal rights.
p26
aVThey don't have the capacity for legal rights.
p27
aVThey are the slaves.
p28
aVOn the other side of that legal wall are the legal persons.
p29
aVLegal persons are very visible to judges.
p30
aVThey count in law.
p31
aVThey may have many rights.
p32
aVThey have the capacity for an infinite number of rights.
p33
aVAnd they're the masters.
p34
aVRight now, all nonhuman animals are legal things.
p35
aVAll human beings are legal persons.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut being human and being a legal person
p38
aVhas never been, and is not today, synonymous with a legal person.
p39
aVHumans and legal persons are not synonymous.
p40
aVOn the one side,
p41
aVthere have been many human beings over the centuries
p42
aVwho have been legal things.
p43
aVSlaves were legal things.
p44
aVWomen, children, were sometimes legal things.
p45
aVIndeed, a great deal of civil rights struggle over the last centuries
p46
aVhas been to punch a hole through that wall and begin to feed
p47
aVthese human things through the wall and have them become legal persons.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut alas, that hole has closed up.
p50
aVNow, on the other side are legal persons,
p51
aVbut they've never only been limited to human beings.
p52
aVThere are, for example, there are many legal persons who are not even alive.
p53
aVIn the United States,
p54
aVwe're aware of the fact that corporations are legal persons.
p55
aVIn pre-independence India,
p56
aVa court held that a Hindu idol was a legal person,
p57
aVthat a mosque was a legal person.
p58
aVIn 2000, the Indian Supreme Court
p59
aVheld that the holy books of the Sikh religion was a legal person,
p60
aVand in 2012, just recently,
p61
aVthere was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of New Zealand
p62
aVand the crown, in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person
p63
aVwho owned its own riverbed.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,
p66
aVwhen I had a full head of lush, brown hair,
p67
aVand indeed I was moved by it,
p68
aVbecause I had become a lawyer because I wanted to speak for the voiceless,
p69
aVdefend the defenseless,
p70
aVand I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless the trillions,
p71
aVbillions of nonhuman animals are.
p72
aVAnd I began to work as an animal protection lawyer.
p73
aVAnd by 1985, I realized that I was trying to accomplish something
p74
aVthat was literally impossible,
p75
aVthe reason being that all of my clients,
p76
aVall the animals whose interests I was trying to defend,
p77
aVwere legal things; they were invisible.
p78
aVIt was not going to work, so I decided
p79
aVthat the only thing that was going to work was they had, at least some of them,
p80
aVhad to also be moved through a hole that we could open up again in that wall
p81
aVand begin feeding the appropriate nonhuman animals through that hole
p82
aVonto the other side of being legal persons.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, at that time, there was very little known about or spoken about
p85
aVtruly animal rights,
p86
aVabout the idea of having legal personhood or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,
p87
aVand I knew it was going to take a long time.
p88
aVAnd so, in 1985, I figured that it would take about 30 years
p89
aVbefore we'd be able to even begin a strategic litigation,
p90
aVlong-term campaign, in order to be able to punch another hole through that wall.
p91
aVIt turned out that I was pessimistic, that it only took 28.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo what we had to do in order to begin was not only
p94
aVto write law review articles and teach classes, write books,
p95
aVbut we had to then begin to get down to the nuts and bolts
p96
aVof how you litigate that kind of case.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo one of the first things we needed to do was figure out what a cause of action was,
p99
aVa legal cause of action.
p100
aVAnd a legal cause of action is a vehicle that lawyers use
p101
aVto put their arguments in front of courts.
p102
aa(lp103
VIt turns out there's a very interesting case
p104
aVthat had occurred almost 250 years ago in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,
p105
aVwhereby a black slave had used the legal system
p106
aVand had moved from a legal thing to a legal person.
p107
aVI was so interested in it that I eventually wrote an entire book about it.
p108
aa(lp109
VJames Somerset was an eight-year-old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa.
p110
aVHe survived the Middle Passage,
p111
aVand he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stewart in Virginia.
p112
aVNow, 20 years later, Stewart brought James Somerset to London,
p113
aVand after he got there, James decided he was going to escape.
p114
aVAnd so one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized,
p115
aVbecause he wanted to get a set of godparents,
p116
aVbecause to an 18th-century slave,
p117
aVthey knew that one of the major responsibilities of godfathers
p118
aVwas to help you escape.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd so in the fall of 1771,
p121
aVJames Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stewart.
p122
aVWe don't know exactly what happened, but then James dropped out of sight.
p123
aVAn enraged Charles Stewart then hired slave catchers
p124
aVto canvass the city of London,
p125
aVfind him, bring him not back to Charles Stewart,
p126
aVbut to a ship, the Ann and Mary, that was floating in London Harbour,
p127
aVand he was chained to the deck,
p128
aVand the ship was to set sail for Jamaica
p129
aVwhere James was to be sold in the slave markets
p130
aVand be doomed to the three to five years of life that a slave had
p131
aVharvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.
p132
aVWell now James' godparents swung into action.
p133
aVThey approached the most powerful judge,
p134
aVLord Mansfield, who was chief judge of the court of King's Bench,
p135
aVand they demanded that he issue a common law writ of habeus corpus
p136
aVon behalf of James Somerset.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, the common law is the kind of law that English-speaking judges can make
p139
aVwhen they're not cabined in by statutes or constitutions,
p140
aVand a writ of habeus corpus is called the Great Writ,
p141
aVcapital G, capital W,
p142
aVand it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against our will.
p143
aVA writ of habeus corpus is issued.
p144
aVThe detainer is required to bring the detainee in
p145
aVand give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty.
p146
aa(lp147
VWell, Lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat,
p148
aVbecause if James Somerset was a legal thing,
p149
aVhe was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus,
p150
aVonly if he could be a legal person.
p151
aVSo Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume,
p152
aVwithout deciding, that James Somerset was indeed a legal person,
p153
aVand he issued the writ of habeus corpus, and James's body was brought in
p154
aVby the captain of the ship.
p155
aa(lp156
VThere were a series of hearings over the next six months.
p157
aVOn June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious,
p158
aVand he used the word "odious,"
p159
aVthat the common law would not support it, and he ordered James free.
p160
aVAt that moment, James Somerset underwent a legal transubstantiation.
p161
aVThe free man who walked out of the courtroom
p162
aVlooked exactly like the slave who had walked in,
p163
aVbut as far as the law was concerned, they had nothing whatsoever in common.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe next thing we did is that the Nonhuman Rights Project,
p166
aVwhich I founded, then began to look at what kind of values and principles
p167
aVdo we want to put before the judges?
p168
aVWhat values and principles did they imbibe with their mother's milk,
p169
aVwere they taught in law school, do they use every day,
p170
aVdo they believe with all their hearts \u2014 and we chose liberty and equality.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, liberty right is the kind of right to which you're entitled
p173
aVbecause of how you're put together,
p174
aVand a fundamental liberty right protects a fundamental interest.
p175
aVAnd the supreme interest in the common law
p176
aVare the rights to autonomy and self-determination.
p177
aVSo they are so powerful that in a common law country,
p178
aVif you go to a hospital and you refuse life-saving medical treatment,
p179
aVa judge will not order it forced upon you,
p180
aVbecause they will respect your self-determination and your autonomy.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, an equality right is the kind of right to which you're entitled
p183
aVbecause you resemble someone else in a relevant way,
p184
aVand there's the rub, relevant way.
p185
aVSo if you are that, then because they have the right, you're like them,
p186
aVyou're entitled to the right.
p187
aVNow, courts and legislatures draw lines all the time.
p188
aVSome are included, some are excluded.
p189
aVBut you have to, at the bare minimum you must \u2014
p190
aVthat line has to be a reasonable means to a legitimate end.
p191
aVThe Nonhuman Rights Project argues that drawing a line
p192
aVin order to enslave an autonomous and self-determining being
p193
aVlike you're seeing behind me,
p194
aVthat that's a violation of equality.
p195
aa(lp196
VWe then searched through 80 jurisdictions,
p197
aVit took us seven years, to find the jurisdiction
p198
aVwhere we wanted to begin filing our first suit.
p199
aVWe chose the state of New York.
p200
aVThen we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be.
p201
aVWe decided upon chimpanzees,
p202
aVnot just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors,
p203
aVbut because they, Jane and others,
p204
aVhave studied chimpanzees intensively for decades.
p205
aVWe know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have,
p206
aVand they also resemble the kind that human beings have.
p207
aVAnd so we chose chimpanzees, and we began to then canvass the world
p208
aVto find the experts in chimpanzee cognition.
p209
aVWe found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Scotland, England and the United States,
p210
aVand amongst them, they wrote 100 pages of affidavits
p211
aVin which they set out more than 40 ways
p212
aVin which their complex cognitive capability,
p213
aVeither individually or together,
p214
aVall added up to autonomy and self-determination.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, these included, for example, that they were conscious.
p217
aVBut they're also conscious that they're conscious.
p218
aVThey know they have a mind. They know that others have minds.
p219
aVThey know they're individuals, and that they can live.
p220
aVThey understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow.
p221
aVThey engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday.
p222
aVThey can anticipate tomorrow,
p223
aVwhich is why it's so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee, especially alone.
p224
aVIt's the thing that we do to our worst criminals,
p225
aVand we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it.
p226
aa(lp227
VThey have some kind of moral capacity.
p228
aVWhen they play economic games with human beings,
p229
aVthey'll spontaneously make fair offers, even when they're not required to do so.
p230
aVThey are numerate. They understand numbers.
p231
aVThey can do some simple math.
p232
aVThey can engage in language \u2014 or to stay out of the language wars,
p233
aVthey're involved in intentional and referential communication
p234
aVin which they pay attention to the attitudes of those
p235
aVwith whom they are speaking.
p236
aVThey have culture.
p237
aVThey have a material culture, a social culture.
p238
aVThey have a symbolic culture.
p239
aVScientists in the Taï Forests in the Ivory Coast
p240
aVfound chimpanzees who were using these rocks to smash open
p241
aVthe incredibly hard hulls of nuts.
p242
aVIt takes a long time to learn how to do that,
p243
aVand they excavated the area and they found
p244
aVthat this material culture, this way of doing it,
p245
aVthese rocks, had passed down for at least 4,300 years
p246
aVthrough 225 chimpanzee generations.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo now we needed to find our chimpanzee.
p249
aVOur chimpanzee,
p250
aVfirst we found two of them in the state of New York.
p251
aVBoth of them would die before we could even get our suits filed.
p252
aVThen we found Tommy.
p253
aVTommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me.
p254
aVTommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage.
p255
aVWe found him in a small room that was filled with cages
p256
aVin a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York.
p257
aVWe found Kiko, who is partially deaf.
p258
aVKiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts.
p259
aVAnd we found Hercules and Leo.
p260
aVThey're two young male chimpanzees
p261
aVwho are being used for biomedical, anatomical research at Stony Brook.
p262
aVWe found them.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd so on the last week of December 2013,
p265
aVthe Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York
p266
aVusing the same common law writ of habeus corpus argument
p267
aVthat had been used with James Somerset,
p268
aVand we demanded that the judges issue these common law writs of habeus corpus.
p269
aVWe wanted the chimpanzees out,
p270
aVand we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps,
p271
aVa tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida
p272
aVwhich involves an artificial lake with 12 or 13 islands \u2014
p273
aVthere are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live
p274
aVon each of them.
p275
aVAnd these chimpanzees would then live the life of a chimpanzee,
p276
aVwith other chimpanzees in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, all these cases are still going on.
p279
aVWe have not yet run into our Lord Mansfield.
p280
aVWe shall. We shall.
p281
aVThis is a long-term strategic litigation campaign. We shall.
p282
aVAnd to quote Winston Churchill,
p283
aVthe way we view our cases is that they're not the end,
p284
aVthey're not even the beginning of the end,
p285
aVbut they are perhaps the end of the beginning.
p286
aa(lp287
VThank you.
