VChris Anderson: So I guess what we're going to do is
p5
aVwe're going to talk about your life,
p6
aVand using some pictures that you shared with me.
p7
aVAnd I think we should start right here with this one.
p8
aVOkay, now who is this?
p9
aa(lp10
VMartine Rothblatt: This is me with our oldest son Eli.
p11
aVHe was about age five.
p12
aVThis is taken in Nigeria
p13
aVright after having taken the Washington, D.C. bar exam.
p14
aa(lp15
VCA: Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine.
p16
aa(lp17
VMR: Right. That was myself as a male, the way I was brought up.
p18
aVBefore I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine.
p19
aa(lp20
VCA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt.
p21
aa(lp22
VMR: Correct.
p23
aa(lp24
VCA: And about a year after this picture, you married a beautiful woman.
p25
aVWas this love at first sight? What happened there?
p26
aa(lp27
VMR: It was love at the first sight.
p28
aVI saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles,
p29
aVand we later began living together,
p30
aVbut the moment I saw her, I saw just an aura of energy around her.
p31
aVI asked her to dance.
p32
aVShe said she saw an aura of energy around me.
p33
aVI was a single male parent. She was a single female parent.
p34
aVWe showed each other our kids' pictures,
p35
aVand we've been happily married for a third of a century now.
p36
aV(Applause)
p37
aa(lp38
VCA: And at the time, you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur,
p39
aVworking with satellites.
p40
aVI think you had two successful companies,
p41
aVand then you started addressing this problem
p42
aVof how could you use satellites to revolutionize radio.
p43
aVTell us about that.
p44
aa(lp45
VMR: Right. I always loved space technology,
p46
aVand satellites, to me, are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors
p47
aVfirst pushed out into the water.
p48
aVSo it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation
p49
aVof the oceans of the sky,
p50
aVand as I developed different types of satellite communication systems,
p51
aVthe main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites,
p52
aVthe consequence of which was that the receiving antennas
p53
aVcould be smaller and smaller,
p54
aVand after going through direct television broadcasting,
p55
aVI had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite,
p56
aVthe receiving dish could be so small
p57
aVthat it would just be a section of a parabolic dish,
p58
aVa flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile,
p59
aVand it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio,
p60
aVand that's Sirius XM today.
p61
aa(lp62
VCA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VMR: Thank you for your monthly subscriptions.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VCA: So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time.
p71
aVIt was a huge commercial success,
p72
aVbut soon after this, in the early 1990s,
p73
aVthere was this big transition in your life and you became Martine.
p74
aa(lp75
VMR: Correct. CA: So tell me, how did that happen?
p76
aVMR: It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children,
p77
aVand I discussed with each of them
p78
aVthat I felt my soul was always female, and as a woman,
p79
aVbut I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it,
p80
aVso I always kept it bottled up
p81
aVand just showed my male side.
p82
aVAnd each of them had a different take on this.
p83
aVBina said, "I love your soul,
p84
aVand whether the outside is Martin and Martine,
p85
aVit doesn't it matter to me, I love your soul."
p86
aVMy son said, "If you become a woman, will you still be my father?"
p87
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I'll always be your father,"
p88
aVand I'm still his father today.
p89
aVMy youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five-year-old thing.
p90
aVShe told people, "I love my dad and she loves me."
p91
aVSo she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever.
p92
aa(lp93
VCA: And a couple years after this, you published this book:
p94
aV"The Apartheid of Sex."
p95
aVWhat was your thesis in this book?
p96
aa(lp97
VMR: My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world,
p98
aVand actually, seven billion unique ways to express one's gender.
p99
aVAnd while people may have the genitals of a male or a female,
p100
aVthe genitals don't determine your gender
p101
aVor even really your sexual identity.
p102
aVThat's just a matter of anatomy
p103
aVand reproductive tracts,
p104
aVand people could choose whatever gender they want
p105
aVif they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female
p106
aVthe way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white.
p107
aVWe know from anthropological science that race is fiction,
p108
aVeven though racism is very, very real,
p109
aVand we now know from cultural studies
p110
aVthat separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction.
p111
aVThe reality is a gender fluidity
p112
aVthat crosses the entire continuum from male to female.
p113
aa(lp114
VCA: You yourself don't always feel 100 percent female.
p115
aa(lp116
VMR: Correct. I would say in some ways
p117
aVI change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle.
p118
aa(lp119
VCA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.
p120
aVAnd I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened.
p121
aa(lp122
VMR: Yes, she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs
p123
aVin our house to her bedroom,
p124
aVand after several months of doctors,
p125
aVshe was diagnosed to have a rare, almost invariably fatal disease
p126
aVcalled pulmonary arterial hypertension.
p127
aa(lp128
VCA: So how did you respond to that?
p129
aa(lp130
VMR: Well, we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could.
p131
aVWe ended up at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
p132
aVThe head of pediatric cardiology
p133
aVtold us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant,
p134
aVbut not to hold out any hope,
p135
aVbecause there are very few lungs available,
p136
aVespecially for children.
p137
aVHe said that all people with this illness died,
p138
aVand if any of you have seen the film "Lorenzo's Oil,"
p139
aVthere's a scene when the protagonist
p140
aVkind of rolls down the stairway crying and bemoaning the fate of his son,
p141
aVand that's exactly how we felt about Jenesis.
p142
aa(lp143
VCA: But you didn't accept that as the limit of what you could do.
p144
aVYou started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow.
p145
aa(lp146
VMR: Correct. She was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time,
p147
aVand Bina and I would tag team to stay at the hospital
p148
aVwhile the other watched the rest of the kids,
p149
aVand when I was in the hospital and she was sleeping,
p150
aVI went to the hospital library.
p151
aVI read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension.
p152
aVI had not taken any biology, even in college,
p153
aVso I had to go from a biology textbook to a college-level textbook
p154
aVand then medical textbook and the journal articles, back and forth,
p155
aVand eventually I knew enough to think that it might be possible
p156
aVthat somebody could find a cure.
p157
aVSo we started a nonprofit foundation.
p158
aVI wrote a description asking people to submit grants
p159
aVand we would pay for medical research.
p160
aVI became an expert on the condition \u2014 doctors said to me, Martine,
p161
aVwe really appreciate all the funding you've provided us,
p162
aVbut we are not going to be able to find a cure in time
p163
aVto save your daughter.
p164
aVHowever, there is a medicine
p165
aVthat was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company
p166
aVthat could halt the progression of the disease,
p167
aVbut Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.
p168
aVThey made a decision not to develop
p169
aVany medicines for rare and orphan diseases,
p170
aVand maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications
p171
aVto develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension.
p172
aa(lp173
VCA: So how on earth did you get access to this drug?
p174
aa(lp175
VMR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome
p176
aVand after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face
p177
aVbecause they weren't going to out-license the drug
p178
aVto a satellite communications expert,
p179
aVthey weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all,
p180
aVand they thought I didn't have the expertise,
p181
aVfinally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me
p182
aVand develop enough credibility.
p183
aVI wore down their resistance,
p184
aVand they had no hope this drug would even work, by the way,
p185
aVand they tried to tell me, "You're just wasting your time.
p186
aVWe're sorry about your daughter."
p187
aVBut finally, for 25,000 dollars
p188
aVand agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get,
p189
aVthey agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug.
p190
aa(lp191
VCA: And so you put this drug on the market in a really brilliant way,
p192
aVby basically charging what it would take to make the economics work.
p193
aa(lp194
VMR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up \u2014
p195
aVafter I wrote the check for 25,000,
p196
aVand I said, "Okay, where's the medicine for Jenesis?"
p197
aVthey said, "Oh, Martine, there's no medicine for Jenesis.
p198
aVThis is just something we tried in rats."
p199
aVAnd they gave me, like, a little plastic Ziploc bag
p200
aVof a small amount of powder.
p201
aVThey said, "Don't give it to any human,"
p202
aVand they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent,
p203
aVand from that, we had to figure out a way to make this medicine.
p204
aVA hundred chemists in the U.S. at the top universities
p205
aVall swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine.
p206
aVIf it was turned into a medicine, it could never be delivered
p207
aVbecause it had a half-life of only 45 minutes.
p208
aa(lp209
VCA: And yet, a year or two later, you were there with a medicine
p210
aVthat worked for Jenesis.
p211
aa(lp212
VMR: Chris, the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless
p213
aVpiece of powder
p214
aVthat had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis
p215
aVis not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today,
p216
aVbut produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VCA: So here you go.
p221
aVSo you took this company public, right?
p222
aVAnd made an absolute fortune.
p223
aVAnd how much have you paid Glaxo, by the way, after that 25,000?
p224
aa(lp225
VMR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them 10 percent of 1.5 billion,
p226
aV150 million dollars, last year 100 million dollars.
p227
aVIt's the best return on investment they ever received. (Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VCA: And the best news of all, I guess,
p230
aVis this.
p231
aa(lp232
VMR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady.
p233
aVShe's alive, healthy today at 30.
p234
aVYou see me, Bina and Jenesis there.
p235
aVThe most amazing thing about Jenesis
p236
aVis that while she could do anything with her life,
p237
aVand believe me, if you grew up your whole life with people
p238
aVin your face saying that you've got a fatal disease,
p239
aVI would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again.
p240
aVBut instead she chooses to work in United Therapeutics.
p241
aVShe says she wants to do all she can to help other people
p242
aVwith orphan diseases get medicines,
p243
aVand today, she's our project leader for all telepresence activities,
p244
aVwhere she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together
p245
aVto find cures for pulmonary hypertension.
p246
aa(lp247
VCA: But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate.
p248
aVThere are still many people dying, and you are tackling that too. How?
p249
aa(lp250
VMR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000 people a year in the United States alone,
p251
aVperhaps 10 times that number worldwide,
p252
aVwho continue to die of this illness
p253
aVbecause the medicines slow down the progression
p254
aVbut they don't halt it.
p255
aVThe only cure for pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis,
p256
aVcystic fibrosis, emphysema,
p257
aVCOPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,
p258
aVis a lung transplant,
p259
aVbut sadly, there are only enough available lungs for 2,000 people
p260
aVin the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant,
p261
aVwhereas nearly a half million people a year
p262
aVdie of end-stage lung failure.
p263
aVCA: So how can you address that?
p264
aVMR: So I conceptualize the possibility
p265
aVthat just like we keep cars and planes
p266
aVand buildings going forever
p267
aVwith an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts,
p268
aVwhy can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs
p269
aVto keep people living indefinitely,
p270
aVand especially people with lung disease.
p271
aVSo we've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome, Craig Venter,
p272
aVand the company he founded
p273
aVwith Peter Diamandis, the founder of the X Prize,
p274
aVto genetically modify
p275
aVthe pig genome
p276
aVso that the pig's organs will not be rejected by the human body
p277
aVand thereby to create an unlimited supply
p278
aVof transplantable organs.
p279
aVWe do this through our company, United Therapeutics.
p280
aa(lp281
VCA: So you really believe that within, what, a decade,
p282
aVthat this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured, through these guys?
p283
aa(lp284
VMR: Absolutely, Chris.
p285
aVI'm as certain of that as I was of the success that we've had
p286
aVwith direct television broadcasting, Sirius XM.
p287
aVIt's actually not rocket science.
p288
aVIt's straightforward engineering away one gene after another.
p289
aVWe're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes
p290
aVis a routine activity,
p291
aVand the brilliant folks at Synthetic Genomics
p292
aVare able to zero in on the pig genome,
p293
aVfind exactly the genes that are problematic, and fix them.
p294
aa(lp295
VCA: But it's not just bodies that \u2014 though that is amazing.
p296
aV(Applause)
p297
aVIt's not just long-lasting bodies that are of interest to you now.
p298
aVIt's long-lasting minds.
p299
aVAnd I think this graph for you says something quite profound.
p300
aVWhat does this mean?
p301
aa(lp302
VMR: What this graph means, and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,
p303
aVis that the rate of development in computer processing
p304
aVhardware, firmware and software,
p305
aVhas been advancing along a curve
p306
aVsuch that by the 2020s, as we saw in earlier presentations today,
p307
aVthere will be information technology
p308
aVthat processes information and the world around us
p309
aVat the same rate as a human mind.
p310
aa(lp311
VCA: And so that being so, you're actually getting ready for this world
p312
aVby believing that we will soon be able to, what,
p313
aVactually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever?
p314
aVHow do you describe that?
p315
aa(lp316
VMR: Well, Chris, what we're working on is creating a situation
p317
aVwhere people can create a mind file,
p318
aVand a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms, personality,
p319
aVrecollection, feelings,
p320
aVbeliefs, attitudes and values,
p321
aVeverything that we've poured today into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,
p322
aVand all of this information stored there will be able, in the next couple decades,
p323
aVonce software is able to recapitulate consciousness,
p324
aVbe able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file.
p325
aa(lp326
VCA: Now you're not just messing around with this.
p327
aVYou're serious. I mean, who is this?
p328
aa(lp329
VMR: This is a robot version of my beloved spouse, Bina.
p330
aVAnd we call her Bina 48.
p331
aVShe was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.
p332
aVThere's the centerfold from National Geographic magazine
p333
aVwith one of her caregivers,
p334
aVand she roams the web
p335
aVand has hundreds of hours of Bina's mannerisms, personalities.
p336
aVShe's kind of like a two-year-old kid,
p337
aVbut she says things that blow people away,
p338
aVbest expressed by perhaps
p339
aVa New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Amy Harmon
p340
aVwho says her answers are often frustrating,
p341
aVbut other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she's interviewed.
p342
aa(lp343
VCA: And is your thinking here, part of your hope here, is that
p344
aVthis version of Bina can in a sense live on forever, or some future upgrade
p345
aVto this version can live on forever?
p346
aVMR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.
p347
aVYou know, it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files
p348
aVon Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.
p349
aVSocial media is I think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time,
p350
aVand as apps become available that will allow us
p351
aVto out-Siri Siri, better and better,
p352
aVand develop consciousness operating systems,
p353
aVeverybody in the world, billions of people,
p354
aVwill be able to develop mind clones of themselves
p355
aVthat will have their own life on the web.
p356
aa(lp357
VCA: So the thing is, Martine,
p358
aVthat in any normal conversation, this would sound stark-staring mad,
p359
aVbut in the context of your life, what you've done,
p360
aVsome of the things we've heard this week,
p361
aVthe constructed realities that our minds give,
p362
aVI mean, you wouldn't bet against it.
p363
aa(lp364
VMR: Well, I think it's really nothing coming from me.
p365
aVIf anything, I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities
p366
aVthat are being undertaken by the greatest companies
p367
aVin China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.
p368
aVThere are tens of millions of people working on writing code
p369
aVthat expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness,
p370
aVand you don't have to be a genius to see that all these threads
p371
aVare going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness,
p372
aVand it's something we'll value.
p373
aVThere are so many things to do in this life,
p374
aVand if we could have a simulacrum, a digital doppelgänger of ourselves
p375
aVthat helps us process books, do shopping,
p376
aVbe our best friends,
p377
aVI believe our mind clones, these digital versions of ourselves,
p378
aVwill ultimately be our best friends,
p379
aVand for me personally and Bina personally,
p380
aVwe love each other like crazy.
p381
aVEach day, we are always saying, like,
p382
aV"Wow, I love you even more than 30 years ago.
p383
aVAnd so for us, the prospect of mind clones
p384
aVand regenerated bodies
p385
aVis that our love affair, Chris, can go on forever.
p386
aVAnd we never get bored of each other. I'm sure we never will.
p387
aa(lp388
VCA: I think Bina's here, right? MR: She is, yeah.
p389
aVCA: Would it be too much, I don't know, do we have a handheld mic?
p390
aVBina, could we invite you to the stage? I just have to ask you one question.
p391
aVBesides, we need to see you.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you, thank you.
p396
aVCome and join Martine here.
p397
aVI mean, look, when you got married,
p398
aVif someone had told you that, in a few years time,
p399
aVthe man you were marrying would become a woman,
p400
aVand a few years after that, you would become a robot \u2014
p401
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p402
aVhow has this gone? How has it been?
p403
aa(lp404
VBina Rothblatt: It's been really an exciting journey,
p405
aVand I would have never thought that at the time,
p406
aVbut we started making goals and setting those goals
p407
aVand accomplishing things,
p408
aVand before you knew it, we just keep going up and up
p409
aVand we're still not stopping, so it's great.
p410
aa(lp411
VCA: Martine told me something really beautiful,
p412
aVjust actually on Skype before this,
p413
aVwhich was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years
p414
aVas a mind file,
p415
aVbut not if it wasn't with you.
p416
aa(lp417
VBR: That's right, we want to do it together.
p418
aVWe're cryonicists as well, and we want to wake up together.
p419
aa(lp420
VCA: So just so as you know, from my point of view,
p421
aVthis isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard,
p422
aVit's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard.
p423
aVIt's just a delight to have you both here at TED.
p424
aVThank you so much.
p425
aa(lp426
VMR: Thank you.
