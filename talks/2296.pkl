VOver the past 10 years,
p5
aVI've been researching the way people organize and visualize information.
p6
aVAnd I've noticed an interesting shift.
p7
aa(lp8
VFor a long period of time,
p9
aVwe believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us,
p10
aValso known as the great chain of being, or "Scala naturae" in Latin,
p11
aVa top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top,
p12
aVfollowed by angels, noblemen,
p13
aVcommon people, animals, and so on.
p14
aVThis idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology,
p15
aVwhich classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories,
p16
aVlike the ones you see behind me.
p17
aVBut over time, interestingly enough,
p18
aVthis concept adopted the branching schema of a tree
p19
aVin what became known as the Porphyrian tree,
p20
aValso considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe branching scheme of the tree was, in fact,
p23
aVsuch a powerful metaphor for conveying information
p24
aVthat it became, over time, an important communication tool
p25
aVto map a variety of systems of knowledge.
p26
aVWe can see trees being used to map morality,
p27
aVwith the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices,
p28
aVas you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe.
p29
aVWe can see trees being used to map consanguinity,
p30
aVthe various blood ties between people.
p31
aVWe can also see trees being used to map genealogy,
p32
aVperhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram.
p33
aVI think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees.
p34
aVMany of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way.
p35
aVWe can see trees even mapping systems of law,
p36
aVthe various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers.
p37
aVAnd finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor,
p38
aVwe can see trees being used to map all species known to man.
p39
aVAnd trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor
p40
aVbecause in many ways, they really embody this human desire
p41
aVfor order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry.
p42
aa(lp43
VHowever, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges
p44
aVthat cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram.
p45
aVAnd a new metaphor is currently emerging,
p46
aVand it's currently replacing the tree
p47
aVin visualizing various systems of knowledge.
p48
aVIt's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us.
p49
aVAnd this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network.
p50
aVAnd we can see this shift from trees into networks
p51
aVin many domains of knowledge.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain.
p54
aVWhile before, we used to think of the brain
p55
aVas a modular, centralized organ,
p56
aVwhere a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors,
p57
aVthe more we know about the brain,
p58
aVthe more we think of it as a large music symphony,
p59
aVplayed by hundreds and thousands of instruments.
p60
aVThis is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project,
p61
aVwhere you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections.
p62
aVAnd this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex.
p63
aVWe can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge.
p64
aa(lp65
VThese are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science,
p66
aVby Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.
p67
aVAnd Llull was actually the precursor,
p68
aVthe very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree,
p69
aVa metaphor we use every single day, when we say,
p70
aV"Biology is a branch of science,"
p71
aVwhen we say,
p72
aV"Genetics is a branch of science."
p73
aVBut perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me,
p74
aVwas created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.
p75
aVThis was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment,
p76
aVand this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents
p77
aVfor the encyclopedia.
p78
aVAnd it actually maps out all domains of knowledge
p79
aVas separate branches of a tree.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut knowledge is much more intricate than this.
p82
aVThese are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles \u2014
p83
aVrelated to history on the left, and mathematics on the right.
p84
aVAnd I think by looking at these maps
p85
aVand other ones that have been created of Wikipedia \u2014
p86
aVarguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man \u2014
p87
aVwe can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate
p88
aVand interdependent, just like a network.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe can also see this interesting shift
p91
aVin the way we map social ties between people.
p92
aVThis is the typical organization chart.
p93
aVI'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well,
p94
aVin your own corporations, or others.
p95
aVIt's a top-down structure
p96
aVthat normally starts with the CEO at the very top,
p97
aVand where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom.
p98
aVBut humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way,
p99
aVand sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure.
p100
aa(lp101
VI think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot.
p102
aVThis is a fantastic map of online social collaboration
p103
aVbetween Perl developers.
p104
aVPerl is a famous programming language,
p105
aVand here, you can see how different programmers
p106
aVare actually exchanging files, and working together on a given project.
p107
aVAnd here, you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process \u2014
p108
aVthere's no leader in this organization,
p109
aVit's a network.
p110
aa(lp111
VWe can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism.
p112
aVOne of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays
p113
aVis that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells,
p114
aVwhere there's no leader leading the whole process.
p115
aVAnd here, you can actually see how visualization is being used.
p116
aVThe diagram that you see behind me
p117
aVshows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004.
p118
aVAnd what they did here is, they actually segmented the network
p119
aVinto three different years,
p120
aVrepresented by the vertical layers that you see behind me.
p121
aVAnd the blue lines tie together
p122
aVthe people that were present in that network year after year.
p123
aVSo even though there's no leader per se,
p124
aVthese people are probably the most influential ones in that organization,
p125
aVthe ones that know more about the past,
p126
aVand the future plans and goals of this particular cell.
p127
aa(lp128
VWe can also see this shift from trees into networks
p129
aVin the way we classify and organize species.
p130
aVThe image on the right is the only illustration
p131
aVthat Darwin included in "The Origin of Species,"
p132
aVwhich Darwin called the "Tree of Life."
p133
aVThere's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher,
p134
aVexpanding on the importance of this particular diagram.
p135
aVIt was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution.
p136
aVBut recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life
p137
aVis a dense network of bacteria,
p138
aVand these bacteria are actually tying together
p139
aVspecies that were completely separated before,
p140
aVto what scientists are now calling not the tree of life,
p141
aVbut the web of life, the network of life.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd finally, we can really see this shift, again,
p144
aVwhen we look at ecosystems around our planet.
p145
aVNo more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams
p146
aVwe have all learned at school.
p147
aVThis is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem.
p148
aVThis is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne,
p149
aVmapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish
p150
aVoff the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.
p151
aVAnd I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature
p152
aVof most ecosystems that abound on our planet.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut even though recent, this metaphor of the network,
p155
aVis really already adopting various shapes and forms,
p156
aVand it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy.
p157
aVIt's almost becoming the syntax of a new language.
p158
aVAnd this is one aspect that truly fascinates me.
p159
aVAnd these are actually 15 different typologies
p160
aVI've been collecting over time,
p161
aVand it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor.
p162
aVAnd here is an example.
p163
aVOn the very top band, you have radial convergence,
p164
aVa visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years.
p165
aVAt the top left, the very first project is a gene network,
p166
aVfollowed by a network of IP addresses \u2014 machines, servers \u2014
p167
aVfollowed by a network of Facebook friends.
p168
aVYou probably couldn't find more disparate topics,
p169
aVyet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model,
p170
aVto map the never-ending complexities of its own subject.
p171
aVAnd here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting,
p172
aVof this growing visual taxonomy of networks.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut networks are not just a scientific metaphor.
p175
aVAs designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems,
p176
aVthey are in many ways influencing traditional art fields,
p177
aVlike painting and sculpture,
p178
aVand influencing many different artists.
p179
aVAnd perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them \u2014
p180
aVthey're immensely gorgeous \u2014
p181
aVthey are really becoming a cultural meme,
p182
aVand driving a new art movement, which I've called "networkism."
p183
aVAnd we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways.
p184
aVThis is just one of many examples,
p185
aVwhere you can see this influence from science into art.
p186
aVThe example on your left side is IP-mapping,
p187
aVa computer-generated map of IP addresses; again \u2014 servers, machines.
p188
aVAnd on your right side,
p189
aVyou have "Transient Structures and Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy,
p190
aVusing oil and enamel on canvas.
p191
aVAnd here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy,
p192
aVsome gorgeous, intricate paintings.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination
p195
aVbetween science and art.
p196
aVOn your left side, you have "Operation Smile."
p197
aVIt is a computer-generated map of a social network.
p198
aVAnd on your right side, you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,
p199
aVusing only graphite on paper.
p200
aVEmma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement,
p201
aVand she creates these striking, imaginary landscapes,
p202
aVwhere you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions.
p205
aVThis is perhaps one of my favorite projects
p206
aVof this new movement.
p207
aVAnd I think the title really says it all \u2014 it's called:
p208
aV"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,
p209
aVLike Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web."
p210
aVAnd I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful.
p211
aVIt was created by Tomás Saraceno,
p212
aVand he occupies these large spaces,
p213
aVcreates these massive installations using only elastic ropes.
p214
aVAs you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes,
p215
aVthe entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd here's yet another example
p218
aVof networkism taken to a whole different level.
p219
aVThis was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota
p220
aVin a piece called "In Silence."
p221
aVAnd Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network,
p222
aVthis dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread,
p223
aVsometimes including objects, as you can see here,
p224
aVsometimes even including people, in many of her installations.
p225
aa(lp226
VBut networks are also not just a new trend,
p227
aVand it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such.
p228
aVNetworks really embody notions of decentralization,
p229
aVof interconnectedness, of interdependence.
p230
aVAnd this new way of thinking is critical
p231
aVfor us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays,
p232
aVfrom decoding the human brain,
p233
aVto understanding the vast universe out there.
p234
aVOn your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse \u2014
p235
aVvery similar to our own at this particular scale.
p236
aVAnd on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation.
p237
aVIt was the largest and most realistic simulation
p238
aVof the growth of cosmic structure.
p239
aVIt was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies
p240
aVin approximately 25 terabytes of output.
p241
aVAnd coincidentally or not,
p242
aVI just find this particular comparison
p243
aVbetween the smallest scale of knowledge \u2014 the brain \u2014
p244
aVand the largest scale of knowledge \u2014 the universe itself \u2014
p245
aVto be really quite striking and fascinating.
p246
aVBecause as Bruce Mau once said,
p247
aV"When everything is connected to everything else,
p248
aVfor better or for worse, everything matters."
p249
aa(lp250
VThank you so much.

While the first period, covering most of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, encapsulated what he denominated as \\u201cproblems of simplicity\\u201d, the second phase, taking place during the first half of the twentieth century, involved \\u201cproblems of disorganized complexity\\". But the last stage defined by Weaver, initiated in the second half of the twentieth century and continuing to this day, is critically shaped by \\u201cproblems of organized complexity\\".
