VOne of my earliest memories
p5
aVis of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to.
p6
aVAnd I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why,
p7
aVbut as I got older,
p8
aVI realized we had drug addiction in my family,
p9
aVincluding later cocaine addiction.
p10
aa(lp11
VI'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years
p12
aVsince drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain,
p13
aVand we then imposed that on the rest of the world.
p14
aVIt's a century since we made this really fateful decision
p15
aVto take addicts and punish them and make them suffer,
p16
aVbecause we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love,
p19
aVand trying to figure out if there was some way to help them.
p20
aVAnd I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions
p21
aVI just didn't know the answer to,
p22
aVlike, what really causes addiction?
p23
aVWhy do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working,
p24
aVand is there a better way out there that we could try instead?
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I read loads of stuff about it,
p27
aVand I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for,
p28
aVso I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world
p29
aVwho lived this and studied this
p30
aVand talk to them and see if I could learn from them.
p31
aVAnd I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start,
p32
aVbut I ended up going and meeting loads of different people,
p33
aVfrom a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn,
p34
aVto a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses
p35
aVto see if they like them \u2014
p36
aVit turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances \u2014
p37
aVto the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs,
p38
aVfrom cannabis to crack, Portugal.
p39
aVAnd the thing I realized that really blew my mind is,
p40
aValmost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong,
p41
aVand if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction,
p42
aVI think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew.
p45
aVLet's think about this middle row here.
p46
aVImagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day.
p47
aVSome of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVDon't worry, it's just a thought experiment.
p50
aVImagine you did that, right?
p51
aVWhat would happen?
p52
aVNow, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.
p53
aVWe think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin,
p54
aVas you took it for a while,
p55
aVyour body would become dependent on those hooks,
p56
aVyou'd start to physically need them,
p57
aVand at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
p58
aVThat's what I thought.
p59
aa(lp60
VFirst thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story
p61
aVis when it was explained to me.
p62
aVIf I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,
p63
aVI'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.
p64
aVDiamorphine is heroin.
p65
aVIt's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets,
p66
aVbecause the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated.
p67
aVActually, very little of it is heroin,
p68
aVwhereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.
p69
aVAnd you'll be given it for quite a long period of time.
p70
aVThere are loads of people in this room,
p71
aVyou may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin.
p72
aVAnd anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening.
p73
aVAnd if what we believe about addiction is right \u2014
p74
aVthose people are exposed to all those chemical hooks \u2014
p75
aVWhat should happen? They should become addicts.
p76
aVThis has been studied really carefully.
p77
aVIt doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement,
p78
aVshe didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me,
p81
aVso contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew,
p82
aVI just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.
p83
aVHe's a professor of psychology in Vancouver
p84
aVwho carried out an incredible experiment
p85
aVI think really helps us to understand this issue.
p86
aVProfessor Alexander explained to me,
p87
aVthe idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story,
p88
aVcomes partly from a series of experiments
p89
aVthat were done earlier in the 20th century.
p90
aVThey're really simple.
p91
aVYou can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.
p92
aVYou get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles:
p93
aVOne is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.
p94
aVIf you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water
p95
aVand almost always kill itself quite quickly.
p96
aVSo there you go, right? That's how we think it works.
p97
aVIn the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment
p98
aVand he noticed something.
p99
aVHe said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage.
p100
aVIt's got nothing to do except use these drugs.
p101
aVLet's try something different.
p102
aVSo Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park,"
p103
aVwhich is basically heaven for rats.
p104
aVThey've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls,
p105
aVthey've got loads of tunnels.
p106
aVCrucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex.
p107
aVAnd they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.
p108
aVBut here's the fascinating thing:
p109
aVIn Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.
p110
aVThey almost never use it.
p111
aVNone of them ever use it compulsively.
p112
aVNone of them ever overdose.
p113
aVYou go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated
p114
aVto zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought,
p117
aVmaybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us.
p118
aVMaybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know \u2014
p119
aVBut fortunately, there was a human experiment
p120
aVinto the exact same principle happening at the exact same time.
p121
aVIt was called the Vietnam War.
p122
aVIn Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin,
p123
aVand if you look at the news reports from the time,
p124
aVthey were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have
p125
aVhundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States
p126
aVwhen the war ends; it made total sense.
p127
aVNow, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home.
p128
aVThe Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study,
p129
aVand what happened to them?
p130
aVIt turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal.
p131
aVNinety-five percent of them just stopped.
p132
aVNow, if you believe the story about chemical hooks,
p133
aVthat makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think
p134
aVthere might be a different story about addiction.
p135
aVHe said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks?
p136
aVWhat if addiction is about your cage?
p137
aVWhat if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?
p138
aa(lp139
VLooking at this,
p140
aVthere was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands
p141
aVwho said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction.
p142
aVMaybe we should call it bonding.
p143
aVHuman beings have a natural and innate need to bond,
p144
aVand when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other,
p145
aVbut if you can't do that,
p146
aVbecause you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life,
p147
aVyou will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.
p148
aVNow, that might be gambling, that might be pornography,
p149
aVthat might be cocaine, that might be cannabis,
p150
aVbut you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature.
p151
aVThat's what we want as human beings.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around,
p154
aVbut one way that helped me to think about it is,
p155
aVI can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right?
p156
aVI'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you.
p157
aVForget the drugs. Forget the drug war.
p158
aVTotally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?
p159
aVWe could all be getting drunk \u2014 I might after this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p160
aVbut we're not.
p161
aVNow, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds
p162
aVthat it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford
p163
aVto be drinking vodka for the next six months.
p164
aVYou wouldn't end up homeless.
p165
aVYou're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that
p166
aVis not because anyone's stopping you.
p167
aVIt's because you've got bonds and connections
p168
aVthat you want to be present for.
p169
aVYou've got work you love. You've got people you love.
p170
aVYou've got healthy relationships.
p171
aVAnd a core part of addiction,
p172
aVI came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests,
p173
aVis about not being able to bear to be present in your life.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, this has really significant implications.
p176
aVThe most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs.
p177
aVIn Arizona, I went out with a group of women
p178
aVwho were made to wear t-shirts saying, "I was a drug addict,"
p179
aVand go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them,
p180
aVand when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records
p181
aVthat mean they'll never work in the legal economy again.
p182
aVNow, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang,
p183
aVbut actually almost everywhere in the world
p184
aVwe treat addicts to some degree like that.
p185
aVWe punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records.
p186
aVWe put barriers between them reconnecting.
p187
aVThere was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,
p188
aVwho said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse,
p189
aVyou would design that system.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite,
p192
aVand I went there to see how it worked.
p193
aVIn the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe.
p194
aVOne percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,
p195
aVand every year, they tried the American way more and more.
p196
aVThey punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more,
p197
aVand every year, the problem got worse.
p198
aVAnd one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together,
p199
aVand basically said, look, we can't go on
p200
aVwith a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts.
p201
aVLet's set up a panel of scientists and doctors
p202
aVto figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.
p203
aVAnd they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,
p204
aVto look at all this new evidence,
p205
aVand they came back and they said,
p206
aV"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but" \u2014
p207
aVand this is the crucial next step \u2014
p208
aV"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off,
p209
aVon disconnecting them,
p210
aVand spend it instead on reconnecting them with society."
p211
aVAnd that's not really what we think of as drug treatment
p212
aVin the United States and Britain.
p213
aVSo they do do residential rehab,
p214
aVthey do psychological therapy, that does have some value.
p215
aVBut the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do:
p216
aVa massive program of job creation for addicts,
p217
aVand microloans for addicts to set up small businesses.
p218
aVSo say you used to be a mechanic.
p219
aVWhen you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say,
p220
aVif you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages.
p221
aVThe goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal
p222
aVhad something to get out of bed for in the morning.
p223
aVAnd when I went and met the addicts in Portugal,
p224
aVwhat they said is, as they rediscovered purpose,
p225
aVthey rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society.
p226
aa(lp227
VIt'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began,
p228
aVand the results are in:
p229
aVinjecting drug use is down in Portugal,
p230
aVaccording to the British Journal of Criminology,
p231
aVby 50 percent, five-zero percent.
p232
aVOverdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts.
p233
aVAddiction in every study is significantly down.
p234
aVOne of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal
p235
aVwants to go back to the old system.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, that's the political implications.
p238
aVI actually think there's a layer of implications
p239
aVto all this research below that.
p240
aVWe live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable
p241
aVto all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones
p242
aVor to shopping or to eating.
p243
aVBefore these talks began \u2014 you guys know this \u2014
p244
aVwe were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on,
p245
aVand I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like
p246
aVaddicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable
p247
aVfor the next couple of hours. (Laughter)
p248
aVA lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say,
p249
aVI've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction
p250
aVand weird to say it's growing,
p251
aVbecause you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely.
p252
aVBut I increasingly began to think that the connections we have
p253
aVor think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection.
p254
aVIf you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something.
p255
aVIt won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you.
p256
aVIt won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round.
p257
aVIt'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced
p258
aVand textured, face-to-face relationships with,
p259
aVand there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,
p260
aVthat I think tells us a lot about this.
p261
aVIt looked at the number of close friends the average American believes
p262
aVthey can call on in a crisis.
p263
aVThat number has been declining steadily since the 1950s.
p264
aVThe amount of floor space an individual has in their home
p265
aVhas been steadily increasing,
p266
aVand I think that's like a metaphor
p267
aVfor the choice we've made as a culture.
p268
aVWe've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections,
p269
aVand the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been.
p270
aVAnd Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says,
p271
aVwe talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery,
p272
aVand it's right to talk about that,
p273
aVbut we need to talk much more about social recovery.
p274
aVSomething's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group,
p275
aVand we've created a society where, for a lot of us,
p276
aVlife looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage
p277
aVand a whole lot less like Rat Park.
p278
aa(lp279
VIf I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it.
p280
aVI didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff.
p281
aVI wanted to know how to help the people I love.
p282
aVAnd when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this,
p283
aVI looked at the addicts in my life,
p284
aVand if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict,
p285
aVand there's going to be lots of people who know in this room.
p286
aVYou are angry a lot of the time,
p287
aVand I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged
p288
aVis because it runs through the heart of each of us, right?
p289
aVEveryone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks,
p290
aVI wish someone would just stop you.
p291
aVAnd the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives
p292
aVis typified by, I think,
p293
aVthe reality show "Intervention," if you guys have ever seen it.
p294
aVI think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV,
p295
aVbut that's another TED Talk.
p296
aVIf you've ever seen the show "Intervention,"
p297
aVit's a pretty simple premise.
p298
aVGet an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together,
p299
aVconfront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up,
p300
aVwe're going to cut you off.
p301
aVSo what they do is they take the connection to the addict,
p302
aVand they threaten it, they make it contingent
p303
aVon the addict behaving the way they want.
p304
aVAnd I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work,
p305
aVand I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War
p306
aVinto our private lives.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese?
p309
aVAnd what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently
p310
aVand I can't tell you it's easy,
p311
aVis to say to the addicts in my life
p312
aVthat I want to deepen the connection with them,
p313
aVto say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not.
p314
aVI love you, whatever state you're in,
p315
aVand if you need me, I'll come and sit with you
p316
aVbecause I love you and I don't want you to be alone
p317
aVor to feel alone.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd I think the core of that message \u2014
p320
aVyou're not alone, we love you \u2014
p321
aVhas to be at every level of how we respond to addicts,
p322
aVsocially, politically and individually.
p323
aVFor 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts.
p324
aVI think all along we should have been singing love songs to them,
p325
aVbecause the opposite of addiction is not sobriety.
p326
aVThe opposite of addiction is connection.
p327
aa(lp328
VThank you.
