VWhen I was 14 years old, I was interested in science \u2014
p5
aVfascinated by it, excited to learn about it.
p6
aVAnd I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class,
p7
aV"The girls don't have to listen to this."
p8
aa(lp9
VEncouraging, yes.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI chose not to listen \u2014 but to that statement alone.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile,
p16
aV500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago.
p17
aVIt's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful.
p18
aVAnd there's not much there.
p19
aVThere are condors, there are tarantulas,
p20
aVand at night, when the light dims,
p21
aVit reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth.
p22
aVIt's kind of a magic place, the mountain.
p23
aVIt's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop
p24
aVwith exquisitely sophisticated technology.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd our ancestors, for as long as there's been recorded history,
p27
aVhave looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence.
p28
aVAnd we're no exception, our generation.
p29
aVThe only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked
p30
aVby the glare of city lights.
p31
aVAnd so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops
p32
aVto view and to study the cosmos.
p33
aVSo telescopes are our window to the cosmos.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be
p36
aVthe future of astronomy for the 21st century.
p37
aVWe have an array of existing telescopes already,
p38
aVin the Andes mountains in Chile,
p39
aVand that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability.
p40
aVThere will be two international groups that are going to be building
p41
aVgiant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are.
p42
aVThere will be a survey telescope
p43
aVthat will be scanning the sky every few nights.
p44
aVThere will be radio telescopes,
p45
aVsensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation.
p46
aVAnd then there will be telescopes in space.
p47
aVThere'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope;
p48
aVit's called the James Webb Telescope,
p49
aVand it will be launched in 2018.
p50
aVThere'll be a satellite called TESS
p51
aVthat will discover planets outside of our solar system.
p52
aa(lp53
VFor the last decade, I've been leading a group \u2014
p54
aVa consortium \u2014 international group,
p55
aVto build what will be, when it's finished,
p56
aVthe largest optical telescope in existence.
p57
aVIt's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT.
p58
aVThis telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8.4 meters in diameter \u2014
p59
aVeach of the mirrors.
p60
aVThat's almost 27 feet.
p61
aVSo it dwarfs this stage \u2014 maybe out to the fourth row in this audience.
p62
aVEach of the seven mirrors in this telescope
p63
aVwill be almost 27 feet in diameter.
p64
aVTogether, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise
p65
aV80 feet in diameter.
p66
aVSo, essentially the size of this entire auditorium.
p67
aVThe whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high,
p68
aVand again, being in Rio,
p69
aVsome of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ.
p70
aVThe scale is comparable in height;
p71
aVin fact, it's smaller than this telescope will be.
p72
aVIt's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty.
p73
aVAnd it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's 22 stories \u2014
p74
aV60 meters high.
p75
aVBut it's an unusual building to protect this telescope.
p76
aVIt will have open windows to the sky,
p77
aVbe able to point and look at the sky,
p78
aVand it will actually rotate on a base \u2014
p79
aV2,000 tons of rotating building.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe Giant Magellan Telescope will have 10 times the resolution
p82
aVof the Hubble Space Telescope.
p83
aVIt will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye.
p84
aVAnd it may, for the first time ever, be capable of finding life on planets
p85
aVoutside of our solar system.
p86
aVIt's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe \u2014
p87
aVliterally, the dawn of the cosmos.
p88
aVThe cosmic dawn.
p89
aVIt's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back,
p90
aVwitness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling,
p91
aVthe first black holes in the universe, the first galaxies.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, for thousands of years, we have been studying the cosmos,
p94
aVwe've been wondering about our place in the universe.
p95
aVThe ancient Greeks told us
p96
aVthat the Earth was the center of the universe.
p97
aVFive hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth,
p98
aVand put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos.
p99
aVAnd as we've learned over the centuries,
p100
aVsince Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist,
p101
aVfirst turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky,
p102
aVevery time we have built larger telescopes,
p103
aVwe have learned something about the universe;
p104
aVwe've made discoveries, without exception.
p105
aVWe've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding
p106
aVand that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion.
p107
aVWe know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies
p108
aVthat are visible to us,
p109
aVand each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos
p112
aVthat's ever been taken.
p113
aVIt was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope,
p114
aVand by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky,
p115
aVbefore the launch of Hubble.
p116
aVAnd if you can imagine this tiny area,
p117
aVit's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon.
p118
aVSo, if you can imagine the full moon.
p119
aVAnd there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image.
p120
aVAnd the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result
p121
aVof the fact that those galaxies are so far away, the vast distances.
p122
aVAnd each of those galaxies may contain within it
p123
aVa few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars.
p124
aVTelescopes are like time machines.
p125
aVSo the farther back we look in space, the further back we see in time.
p126
aVAnd they're like light buckets \u2014 literally, they collect light.
p127
aVSo larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have,
p128
aVthe more light we can see, and the farther back we can view.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, we've learned in the last century
p131
aVthat there are exotic objects in the universe \u2014 black holes.
p132
aVWe've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy
p133
aVthat we can't see.
p134
aVSo you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VYou got it. Not all audiences get that.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VSo the way we infer the presence of dark matter \u2014
p143
aVwe can't see it \u2014 but there's an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.
p144
aVWe now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies
p145
aVin a universe that's expanding.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe,
p148
aVand one of the projects that I carried out in the 1990s
p149
aVused the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding.
p150
aVWe can now trace back to 14 billion years.
p151
aVWe've learned over time that stars have individual histories;
p152
aVthat is, they have birth, they have middle ages
p153
aVand some of them even have dramatic deaths.
p154
aVSo the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see,
p155
aVmost of which turn out to have planets going around them.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years
p158
aVhas been the discovery of other planets going around other stars.
p159
aVThese are called exoplanets.
p160
aVAnd until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets,
p161
aVother than going around our own sun.
p162
aVBut now, there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars
p163
aVthat we can now detect, measure masses for.
p164
aVThere are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems.
p165
aVAnd there are 4,000 \u2014 and still counting \u2014 other candidates
p166
aVfor planets orbiting other stars.
p167
aVThey come in a bewildering variety of different kinds.
p168
aVThere are Jupiter-like planets that are hot,
p169
aVthere are other planets that are icy, there are water worlds
p170
aVand there are rocky planets like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,"
p171
aVand there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo we know there's at least one planet, our own Earth, in which there is life.
p174
aVWe've even found planets that are orbiting two stars.
p175
aVThat's no longer the province of science fiction.
p176
aVSo around our own planet, we know there's life,
p177
aVwe've developed a complex life, we now can question our own origins.
p178
aVAnd given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest
p179
aVthat there may be millions, perhaps \u2014 maybe even hundreds of millions \u2014
p180
aVof other [planets] that are close enough \u2014
p181
aVjust the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting \u2014
p182
aVto have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life.
p183
aVSo we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds,
p184
aVand the amazing thing is that within the next decade,
p185
aVthe GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets,
p186
aVand determine whether or not they have the potential for life.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, what is the GMT project?
p189
aVIt's an international project.
p190
aVIt includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,
p191
aVthat the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VIt also includes a number of institutions across the United States,
p196
aVincluding Harvard University,
p197
aVthe Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions,
p198
aVand the Universities of Arizona, Chicago, Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University.
p199
aVIt also involves Chile.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating
p202
aVin its own right.
p203
aVTake chunks of glass, melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating.
p204
aVThis happens underneath the football stadium
p205
aVat the University of Arizona.
p206
aVIt's tucked away under 52,000 seats.
p207
aVNobody know it's happening.
p208
aVAnd there's essentially a rotating cauldron.
p209
aVThe mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly,
p210
aVand then they're polished to an exquisite precision.
p211
aVAnd so, if you think about the precision of these mirrors,
p212
aVthe bumps on the mirror, over the entire 27 feet,
p213
aVamount to less than one-millionth of an inch.
p214
aVSo, can you visualize that?
p215
aVOw!
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThat's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs,
p220
aVover this entire 27 feet.
p221
aVIt's a spectacular achievement.
p222
aVIt's what allows us to have the precision that we will have.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo, what does that precision buy us?
p225
aVSo the GMT, if you can imagine \u2014
p226
aVif I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have,
p227
aVand I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here
p228
aVthe writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin.
p229
aVMy guess that even in the front row, you can't see that.
p230
aVBut if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope,
p231
aVall 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium,
p232
aVand point it 200 miles away,
p233
aVif I were standing in São Paulo, we could resolve the face of this coin.
p234
aVThat's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope.
p235
aVAnd if we were \u2014
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VIf an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away,
p240
aVand lit a candle \u2014 a single candle \u2014
p241
aVthen we would be able to detect it, using the GMT.
p242
aVQuite extraordinary.
p243
aa(lp244
VThis is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.
p245
aV"Nearby" is astronomical, it's all relative.
p246
aVIt's tens of millions of light-years away.
p247
aVThis is what this cluster would look like.
p248
aVSo look at those four bright objects,
p249
aVand now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.
p250
aVYou can see faint detail that starts to come through.
p251
aVAnd now finally \u2014 and look how dramatic this is \u2014 this is what the GMT will see.
p252
aVSo, keep your eyes on those bright images again.
p253
aVThis is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,
p254
aVand this, again, what the GMT will see.
p255
aVExtraordinary precision.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo, where are we?
p258
aVWe have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile.
p259
aVWe blasted that off.
p260
aVWe've tested and polished the first mirror.
p261
aVWe've cast the second and the third mirrors.
p262
aVAnd we're about to cast the fourth mirror.
p263
aVWe had a series of reviews this year,
p264
aVinternational panels that came in and reviewed us,
p265
aVand said, "You're ready to go to construction."
p266
aVAnd so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors.
p267
aVWe want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data \u2014
p268
aVwhat we astronomers call "first light," in 2021.
p269
aVAnd the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade,
p270
aVwith all seven mirrors.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo we're now poised to look back at the distant universe,
p273
aVthe cosmic dawn.
p274
aVWe'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GMT
p277
aVis the opportunity to actually discover something
p278
aVthat we don't know about \u2014 that we can't even imagine at this point,
p279
aVsomething completely new.
p280
aVAnd my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities,
p281
aVthat many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars.
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you very much.
p284
aVObrigado.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Applause)
p287
aa(lp288
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.
p289
aVStay with me, because I have a question for you.
p290
aVYou mentioned different facilities.
p291
aVSo the Magellan Telescope is going up, but also ALMA and others in Chile
p292
aVand elsewhere, including in Hawaii.
p293
aVIs it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition?
p294
aVI know there's competition in terms of funding, but what about the science?
p295
aa(lp296
VWendy Freedman: In terms of the science, they're very complementary.
p297
aVThe telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground,
p298
aVtelescopes with different wavelength capability,
p299
aVtelescopes even that are similar, but different instruments \u2014
p300
aVthey will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking.
p301
aVSo when we discover other planets, we'll be able to test those observations,
p302
aVwe'll be able to measure the atmospheres,
p303
aVbe able to look in space with very high resolution.
p304
aVSo, they're very complementary.
p305
aVYou're right about the funding, we compete;
p306
aVbut scientifically, it's very complementary.
p307
aa(lp308
VBG: Wendy, thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal.
p309
aa(lp310
VWF: Thank you.
