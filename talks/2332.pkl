(lp4
VWow, what an honor. I always wondered what this would feel like.
p5
aa(lp6
VSo eight years ago, I got the worst career advice of my life.
p7
aVI had a friend tell me,
p8
aV"Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now.
p9
aVIt's all about just building your resume."
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while,
p12
aVand I'd joined this Fortune 500 company. I thought, "This is fantastic.
p13
aVI'm going to have big impact on the world."
p14
aVI had all these ideas. And within about two months,
p15
aVI noticed at about 10am every morning I had this strange urge
p16
aVto want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer.
p17
aVI don't know if anyone's ever felt that.
p18
aVAnd I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space
p19
aVhad already automated my job role.
p20
aVAnd this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume.
p21
aa(lp22
VWell, as I'm trying to figure out
p23
aVwhat two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up,
p24
aVI read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said,
p25
aV"Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age."
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I heard that, and that was all I needed.
p30
aVWithin two weeks, I was out of there, and I left with one intention:
p31
aVto find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was.
p32
aVI wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone:
p35
aVit turns out that over 80 percent of the people around
p36
aVdon't enjoy their work.
p37
aVI'm guessing this room is different,
p38
aVbut that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies.
p39
aVSo I wanted to find out, what is it that sets these people apart,
p40
aVthe people who do the passionate, world-changing work,
p41
aVthat wake up inspired every day,
p42
aVand then these people, the other 80 percent
p43
aVwho lead these lives of quiet desperation.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work,
p46
aVand I read books and did case studies,
p47
aV300 books altogether on purpose and career and all this,
p48
aVtotally just self-immersion, really for the selfish reason of \u2014
p49
aVI wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do,
p50
aVwhat that was for me.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut as I was doing this, more and more people started to ask me,
p53
aV"You're into this career thing.
p54
aVI don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch?"
p55
aVI'd say, "Sure." But I would have to warn them,
p56
aVbecause at this point, my quit rate was also 80 percent.
p57
aVOf the people I'd sit down with for lunch, 80 percent would quit their job
p58
aVwithin two months.
p59
aVI was proud of this, and it wasn't that I had any special magic.
p60
aVIt was that I would ask one simple question.
p61
aVIt was, "Why are you doing the work that you're doing?"
p62
aVAnd so often their answer would be,
p63
aV"Well, because somebody told me I'm supposed to."
p64
aVAnd I realized that so many people around us
p65
aVare climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb,
p66
aVand it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall,
p67
aVor no wall at all.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe more time I spent around these people and saw this problem,
p70
aVI thought, what if we could create a community,
p71
aVa place where people could feel like they belonged
p72
aVand that it was OK to do things differently,
p73
aVto take the road less traveled, where that was encouraged,
p74
aVand inspire people to change?
p75
aVAnd that later became what I now call Live Your Legend,
p76
aVwhich I'll explain in a little bit.
p77
aVBut as I've made these discoveries, I noticed a framework
p78
aVof really three simple things
p79
aVthat all these different passionate world-changers have in common,
p80
aVwhether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just, you know,
p81
aVthe person that has the bakery down the street.
p82
aVBut you're doing work that embodies who you are.
p83
aVI want to share those three with you, so we can use them as a lens
p84
aVfor the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe first part of this three-step passionate work framework
p87
aVis becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself,
p88
aVbecause if you don't know what you're looking for,
p89
aVyou're never going to find it.
p90
aVAnd the thing is that no one is going to do this for us.
p91
aVThere's no major in university on passion and purpose and career.
p92
aVI don't know how that's not a required double major,
p93
aVbut don't even get me started on that.
p94
aVI mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set
p95
aVthan you do you picking your major and your area of study.
p96
aVBut the point is, it's on us to figure that out,
p97
aVand we need a framework, we need a way to navigate through this.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are.
p100
aVWhat are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what,
p101
aVwhether we're paid or we're not paid, the things that people thank us for?
p102
aVAnd the Strengths Finder 2.0 is a book and also an online tool.
p103
aVI highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd next, what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions?
p106
aVDo we care about the people, our family, health,
p107
aVor is it achievement, success, all this stuff?
p108
aVWe have to figure out what it is to make these decisions,
p109
aVso we know what our soul is made of,
p110
aVso that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd then the next step is our experiences.
p113
aVAll of us have these experiences. We learn things every day, every minute
p114
aVabout what we love, what we hate,
p115
aVwhat we're good at, what we're terrible at.
p116
aVAnd if we don't spend time paying attention to that
p117
aVand assimilating that learning
p118
aVand applying it to the rest of our lives, it's all for nothing.
p119
aVEvery day, every week, every month of every year
p120
aVI spend some time just reflecting on what went right,
p121
aVwhat went wrong, and what do I want to repeat,
p122
aVwhat can I apply more to my life.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd even more so than that, as you see people, especially today,
p125
aVwho inspire you, who are doing things where you say
p126
aV"Oh God, what Jeff is doing, I want to be like him."
p127
aVWhy are you saying that? Open up a journal.
p128
aVWrite down what it is about them that inspires you.
p129
aVIt's not going to be everything about their life,
p130
aVbut whatever it is, take note on that,
p131
aVso over time we'll have this repository of things
p132
aVthat we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence
p133
aVand make a better impact.
p134
aVBecause when we start to put these things together,
p135
aVwe can then define what success actually means to us,
p136
aVand without these different parts of the compass, it's impossible.
p137
aVWe end up in the situation \u2014 we have that scripted life
p138
aVthat everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere.
p139
aa(lp140
VIt's kind of like in Wall Street 2, if anybody saw that,
p141
aVthe peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO,
p142
aV"What's your number? Everyone's got a number,
p143
aVwhere if they make this money, they'll leave it all."
p144
aVHe says, "Oh, it's simple. More."
p145
aVAnd he just smiles.
p146
aVAnd it's the sad state of most of the people
p147
aVthat haven't spent time understanding what matters for them,
p148
aVwho keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us,
p149
aVbut we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to.
p150
aVBut once we have this framework together,
p151
aVwe can start to identify the things that make us come alive.
p152
aVYou know, before this, a passion could come and hit you in the face,
p153
aVor maybe in your possible line of work, you might throw it away
p154
aVbecause you don't have a way of identifying it.
p155
aVBut once you do, you can see something that's congruent with my strengths,
p156
aVmy values, who I am as a person,
p157
aVso I'm going to grab ahold of this, I'm going to do something with it,
p158
aVand I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd Live Your Legend and the movement we've built
p161
aVwouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify,
p162
aV"Wow, this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with."
p163
aVIf we don't know what we're looking for, we're never going to find it,
p164
aVbut once we have this framework, this compass,
p165
aVthen we can move on to what's next \u2014 and that's not me up there \u2014
p166
aVdoing the impossible and pushing our limits.
p167
aVThere's two reasons why people don't do things.
p168
aVOne is they tell themselves they can't do them,
p169
aVor people around them tell them they can't do them.
p170
aVEither way, we start to believe it.
p171
aVEither we give up, or we never start in the first place.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe things is, everyone was impossible until somebody did it.
p174
aVEvery invention, every new thing in the world,
p175
aVpeople thought were crazy at first.
p176
aVRoger Bannister and the four-minute mile, it was a physical impossibility
p177
aVto break the four-minute mile in a foot race
p178
aVuntil Roger Bannister stood up and did it.
p179
aVAnd then what happened?
p180
aVTwo months later, 16 people broke the four-minute mile.
p181
aVThe things that we have in our head that we think are impossible
p182
aVare often just milestones waiting to be accomplished
p183
aVif we can push those limits a bit.
p184
aVAnd I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness
p185
aVmore than anything, because we can control that.
p186
aVIf you don't think you can run a mile,
p187
aVyou show yourself you can run a mile or two,
p188
aVor a marathon, or lose five pounds, or whatever it is,
p189
aVyou realize that confidence compounds
p190
aVand can be transferred into the rest of your world.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends.
p193
aVWe have this little group. We go on physical adventures,
p194
aVand recently, I found myself in a kind of precarious spot.
p195
aVI'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.
p196
aVI don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear
p197
aVever since they watched Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times
p198
aVwhen I was a kid.
p199
aVBut anything above here, if it's murky, I can already feel it right now.
p200
aVI swear there's something in there.
p201
aVEven if it's Lake Tahoe, it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,
p202
aVridiculous, but it's there.
p203
aVAnyway, three years ago I find myself on this tugboat
p204
aVright down here in the San Francisco Bay.
p205
aVIt's a rainy, stormy, windy day, and people are getting sick on the boat,
p206
aVand I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit, and I'm looking out the window
p207
aVin pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death.
p208
aVI'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate.
p209
aVAnd my guess is some people in this room might have done that before.
p210
aVI'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan, who had talked me into it,
p211
aVhe comes up to me and he could see the state I was in.
p212
aVAnd he says, "Scott, hey man, what's the worst that could happen?
p213
aVYou're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink.
p214
aVAnd If you can't make it, just hop on one of the 20 kayaks.
p215
aVPlus, if there's a shark attack, why are they going to pick you
p216
aVover the 80 people in the water?" So thanks, that helps.
p217
aVHe's like, "But really, just have fun with this. Good luck."
p218
aVAnd he dives in, swims off. OK.
p219
aa(lp220
VTurns out, the pep talk totally worked, and I felt this total feeling of calm,
p221
aVand I think it was because Jonathan was 13 years old.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd of the 80 people swimming that day,
p226
aV65 of them were between the ages of nine and 13.
p227
aVThink how you would have approached your world differently
p228
aVif at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half
p229
aVin 56-degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco.
p230
aVWhat would you have said yes to?
p231
aVWhat would you have not given up on? What would you have tried?
p232
aVAs I'm finishing this swim, I get to Aquatic Park,
p233
aVand I'm getting out of the water
p234
aVand of course half the kids are already finished,
p235
aVso they're cheering me on and they're all excited.
p236
aVAnd I got total popsicle head, if anyone's ever swam in the Bay,
p237
aVand I'm trying to just thaw my face out, and I'm watching people finish.
p238
aVAnd I see this one kid, something didn't look right.
p239
aVAnd he's just flailing like this.
p240
aVAnd he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down.
p241
aVAnd I notice other parents were watching too,
p242
aVand I swear they were thinking the same thing I was:
p243
aVthis is why you don't let nine-year-olds swim from Alcatraz.
p244
aVThis was not fatigue.
p245
aVAll of a sudden, two parents run up and grab him,
p246
aVand they put him on their shoulders, and they're dragging him like this,
p247
aVtotally limp.
p248
aVAnd then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet
p249
aVand they plop him down in his wheelchair.
p250
aVAnd he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen.
p251
aVI can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy
p252
aVwhen he made this accomplishment.
p253
aVI had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair.
p254
aVI just had no idea he was going to swim.
p255
aVI mean, where is he going to be in 20 years?
p256
aVHow many people told him he couldn't do that, that he would die if tried that?
p257
aa(lp258
VYou prove people wrong, you prove yourself wrong,
p259
aVthat you can make little incremental pushes
p260
aVof what you believe is possible.
p261
aVYou don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world,
p262
aVjust your own impossibilities, to accomplish those,
p263
aVand it starts with little bitty steps.
p264
aVAnd the best way to do this
p265
aVis to surround yourself with passionate people.
p266
aVThe fastest things to do things you don't think can be done
p267
aVis to surround yourself with people already doing them.
p268
aa(lp269
VThere's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.
p270
aV"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."
p271
aVAnd there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world
p272
aVfrom getting where you are today to where you want to be
p273
aVthan the people you choose to put in your corner.
p274
aVThey change everything, and it's a proven fact.
p275
aVIn 1898, Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists,
p276
aVand he would measure their times around the track in a group,
p277
aVand also individually.
p278
aVAnd he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster.
p279
aVAnd it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then,
p280
aVand it proves the same thing over again,
p281
aVthat the people around you matter, and environment is everything.
p282
aVBut it's on you to control it, because it can go both ways.
p283
aVWith 80 percent of people who don't like the work they do,
p284
aVthat means most people around us, not in this room, but everywhere else,
p285
aVare encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us
p286
aVso we have to manage those surroundings.
p287
aa(lp288
VI found myself in this situation \u2014
p289
aVpersonal example, a couple years ago.
p290
aVHas anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into,
p291
aVunbelievable amount of time, and they so badly want to call it a business,
p292
aVbut no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime?
p293
aVOK, I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement
p294
aVto help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them,
p295
aVand I was doing all I could,
p296
aVand there were only three people paying attention,
p297
aVand they're all right there: my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.
p298
aVThank you guys for the support.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Applause)
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd this is how badly I wanted it, it grew at zero percent for four years,
p303
aVand I was about to shut it down,
p304
aVand right about then,
p305
aVI moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people
p306
aVwho had these crazy lifestyles of adventure,
p307
aVof businesses and websites and blogs
p308
aVthat surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way.
p309
aVAnd one of my friends, now, he has a family of eight,
p310
aVand he supports his whole family
p311
aVwith a blog that he writes for twice a week.
p312
aVThey just came back from a month in Europe, all of them together.
p313
aVThis blew my mind. How does this even exist?
p314
aVAnd I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this,
p315
aVand instead of shutting it down, I decided, let's take it seriously.
p316
aVAnd I did everything I could to spend my time,
p317
aVevery waking hour possible trying to hound these guys,
p318
aVhanging out and having beers and workouts, whatever it was.
p319
aVAnd after four years of zero growth,
p320
aVwithin six months of hanging around these people,
p321
aVthe community at Live Your Legend grew by 10 times.
p322
aVIn another 12 months, it grew by 160 times.
p323
aVAnd today over 30,000 people from 158 countries
p324
aVuse our career and connection tools on a monthly basis.
p325
aVAnd those people have made up that community of passionate folks
p326
aVwho inspired that possibility that I dreamed of
p327
aVfor Live Your Legend so many years back.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe people change everything, and this is why \u2014
p330
aVyou know, you ask what was going on.
p331
aVWell, for four years, I knew nobody in this space,
p332
aVand I didn't even know it existed, that people could do this stuff,
p333
aVthat you could have movements like this.
p334
aVAnd then I'm over here in San Francisco, and everyone around me was doing it.
p335
aVIt became normal, so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this
p336
aVto how could I possibly not.
p337
aVAnd right then, when that happens, that switch goes on in your head,
p338
aVit ripples across your whole world.
p339
aVAnd without even trying, your standards go from here to here.
p340
aVYou don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings.
p341
aVThat's it, and that's why I love being around this whole group of people,
p342
aVwhy I go to every TED event I can,
p343
aVand watch them on my iPad on the way to work, whatever it is.
p344
aVBecause this is the group of people that inspires possibility.
p345
aVWe have a whole day to spend together and plenty more.
p346
aa(lp347
VTo sum things up, in terms of these three pillars,
p348
aVthey all have one thing in common more than anything else.
p349
aVThey are 100 percent in our control.
p350
aVNo one can tell you you can't learn about yourself.
p351
aVNo one can tell you you can't push your limits
p352
aVand learn your own impossible and push that.
p353
aVNo one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people
p354
aVor get away from the people who bring you down.
p355
aVYou can't control a recession.
p356
aVYou can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident.
p357
aVMost things are totally out of our hands.
p358
aVThese three things are totally on us,
p359
aVand they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd the thing is, it's starting to happen on a widespread level.
p362
aVI just read in Forbes, the US Government reported for the first time
p363
aVin a month where more people had quit their jobs
p364
aVthan had been laid off.
p365
aVThey thought this was an anomaly, but it's happened three months straight.
p366
aVIn a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment,
p367
aVpeople are giving a middle finger to this scripted life,
p368
aVthe things that people say you're supposed to do,
p369
aVin exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd the thing is, people are waking up to this possibility,
p372
aVthat really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination.
p373
aVThat's not a cliché anymore.
p374
aVI don't care what it is that you're into, what passion, what hobby.
p375
aVIf you're into knitting, you can find someone who is killing it knitting,
p376
aVand you can learn from them. It's wild.
p377
aVAnd that's what this whole day is about, to learn from the folks speaking,
p378
aVand we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day,
p379
aVbecause when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary,
p380
aVand we can be around that,
p381
aVit becomes normal.
p382
aVAnd this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy.
p383
aVIt's just about doing something that matters to you,
p384
aVand makes an impact that only you can make.
p385
aa(lp386
VSpeaking of Gandhi, he was a recovering lawyer,
p387
aVas I've heard the term,
p388
aVand he was called to a greater cause, something that mattered to him,
p389
aVhe couldn't not do.
p390
aVAnd he has this quote that I absolutely live by.
p391
aV"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,
p392
aVthen they fight you, then you win."
p393
aa(lp394
VEverything was impossible until somebody did it.
p395
aVYou can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done
p396
aVand tell you you're stupid for trying,
p397
aVor surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility,
p398
aVthe people who are in this room.
p399
aVBecause I see it as our responsibility to show the world
p400
aVthat what's seen as impossible can become that new normal.
p401
aVAnd that's already starting to happen.
p402
aVFirst, do the things that inspire us,
p403
aVso we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them.
p404
aVBut we can't find that
p405
aVunless we know what we're looking for.
p406
aVWe have to do our work on ourself,
p407
aVbe intentional about that, and make those discoveries.
p408
aVBecause I imagine a world where 80 percent of people love the work they do.
p409
aVWhat would that look like?
p410
aVWhat would the innovation be like? How would you treat the people around you?
p411
aVThings would start to change.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd as we finish up, I have just one question to ask you guys,
p414
aVand I think it's the only question that matters.
p415
aVAnd it's what is the work you can't not do?
p416
aVDiscover that, live it,
p417
aVnot just for you, but for everybody around you,
p418
aVbecause that is what starts to change the world.
p419
aVWhat is the work you can't not do?
p420
