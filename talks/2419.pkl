VThis is Pleurobot.
p5
aVPleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species
p6
aVcalled Pleurodeles waltl.
p7
aVPleurobot can walk, as you can see here,
p8
aVand as you'll see later, it can also swim.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo you might ask, why did we design this robot?
p11
aVAnd in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
p12
aVIndeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists
p13
aVto understand how animals move,
p14
aVand especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.
p15
aVBut the more I work in biorobotics,
p16
aVthe more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.
p17
aVIf you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around,
p18
aVor even us as humans,
p19
aVwhen you go jogging or play tennis,
p20
aVwe do amazing things.
p21
aVAnd in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
p22
aVIt has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly,
p23
aVbecause if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
p24
aVAnd my goal is to understand how this works.
p25
aa(lp26
VThere are four main components behind animal locomotion.
p27
aVThe first component is just the body,
p28
aVand in fact we should never underestimate
p29
aVto what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals.
p30
aVThen you have the spinal cord,
p31
aVand in the spinal cord you find reflexes,
p32
aVmultiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop
p33
aVbetween neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity.
p34
aVA third component are central pattern generators.
p35
aVThese are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals
p36
aVthat can generate, by themselves,
p37
aVvery coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity
p38
aVwhile receiving only very simple input signals.
p39
aVAnd these input signals
p40
aVcoming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain,
p41
aVlike the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,
p42
aVwill all modulate activity of the spinal cord
p43
aVwhile we do locomotion.
p44
aVBut what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component,
p45
aVthe spinal cord, together with the body,
p46
aValready solve a big part of the locomotion problem.
p47
aVYou probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken,
p48
aVit can still run for a while,
p49
aVshowing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body,
p50
aValready solve a big part of locomotion.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, understanding how this works is very complex,
p53
aVbecause first of all,
p54
aVrecording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult.
p55
aVIt's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex
p56
aVthan in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae.
p57
aVEspecially in humans, very hard to do.
p58
aVA second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex
p59
aVand very dynamic interaction between these four components.
p60
aVSo it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time.
p61
aVThis is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models
p62
aVcan really help.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo what's biorobotics?
p65
aVBiorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics
p66
aVwhere people want to take inspiration from animals
p67
aVto make robots to go outdoors,
p68
aVlike service robots or search and rescue robots
p69
aVor field robots.
p70
aVAnd the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals
p71
aVto make robots that can handle complex terrain \u2014
p72
aVstairs, mountains, forests,
p73
aVplaces where robots still have difficulties
p74
aVand where animals can do a much better job.
p75
aVThe robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well.
p76
aVThere are some very nice projects where robots are used,
p77
aVlike a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.
p78
aVAnd this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot.
p79
aVSo what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists
p80
aVlike Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,
p81
aVand we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots.
p82
aVAnd here we want to start simple.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo it's good to start with simple animals
p85
aVlike lampreys, which are very primitive fish,
p86
aVand then gradually go toward more complex locomotion,
p87
aVlike in salamanders,
p88
aVbut also in cats and in humans,
p89
aVin mammals.
p90
aVAnd here, a robot becomes an interesting tool
p91
aVto validate our models.
p92
aVAnd in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true.
p93
aVLike, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer
p94
aVmaking simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion
p95
aVduring my PhD.
p96
aVBut I always knew that my simulations were just approximations.
p97
aVLike, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground,
p98
aVit's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer.
p99
aVWhy not have a real robot and real physics?
p100
aVSo among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander.
p101
aVYou might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian,
p102
aVit's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view.
p103
aVIt makes a wonderful link between swimming,
p104
aVas you find it in eels or fish,
p105
aVand quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
p106
aVAnd in fact, the modern salamander
p107
aVis very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate,
p108
aVso it's almost a living fossil,
p109
aVwhich gives us access to our ancestor,
p110
aVthe ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo the salamander swims
p113
aVby doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait,
p114
aVso they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.
p115
aVAnd if you place the salamander on the ground,
p116
aVit switches to what's called a walking trot gait.
p117
aVIn this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs
p118
aVwhich are very nicely coordinated
p119
aVwith this standing wave undulation of the body,
p120
aVand that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.
p121
aVNow, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact
p122
aVis the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body.
p123
aVSo if you take a decerebrated salamander \u2014
p124
aVit's not so nice but you remove the head \u2014
p125
aVand if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord,
p126
aVat low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait.
p127
aVIf you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates.
p128
aVAnd at some point, there's a threshold,
p129
aVand automatically, the animal switches to swimming.
p130
aVThis is amazing.
p131
aVJust changing the global drive,
p132
aVas if you are pressing the gas pedal
p133
aVof descending modulation to your spinal cord,
p134
aVmakes a complete switch between two very different gaits.
p135
aVAnd in fact, the same has been observed in cats.
p136
aVIf you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,
p137
aVyou can switch between walk, trot and gallop.
p138
aVOr in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking,
p139
aVat a low level of stimulation,
p140
aVand flapping its wings at high-level stimulation.
p141
aVAnd this really shows that the spinal cord
p142
aVis a very sophisticated locomotion controller.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we studied salamander locomotion in more detail,
p145
aVand we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine
p146
aVfrom Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany.
p147
aVAnd thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine
p148
aVto record all the bone motion in great detail.
p149
aVThat's what we did.
p150
aVSo we basically figured out which bones are important for us
p151
aVand collected their motion in 3D.
p152
aVAnd what we did is collect a whole database of motions,
p153
aVboth on ground and in water,
p154
aVto really collect a whole database of motor behaviors
p155
aVthat a real animal can do.
p156
aVAnd then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot.
p157
aVSo we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure,
p158
aVwhere to place the motors, how to connect them together,
p159
aVto be able to replay these motions as well as possible.
p160
aVAnd this is how Pleurobot came to life.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo let's look at how close it is to the real animal.
p163
aVSo what you see here is almost a direct comparison
p164
aVbetween the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot.
p165
aVYou can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay
p166
aVof the walking gait.
p167
aVIf you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better.
p168
aVBut even better, we can do swimming.
p169
aVSo for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
Vand then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits.
p174
aVAnd here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do.
p175
aVThe physics of interaction are complex.
p176
aVOur robot is much bigger than a small animal,
p177
aVso we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies
p178
aVto make sure we had the same interaction physics.
p179
aVBut you see at the end, we have a very close match,
p180
aVand we were very, very happy with this.
p181
aVSo let's go to the spinal cord.
p182
aVSo here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen
p183
aVis model the spinal cord circuits.
p184
aVAnd what's interesting is that the salamander
p185
aVhas kept a very primitive circuit,
p186
aVwhich is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey,
p187
aVthis primitive eel-like fish,
p188
aVand it looks like during evolution,
p189
aVnew neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs,
p190
aVto do the leg locomotion.
p191
aVAnd we know where these neural oscillators are
p192
aVbut what we did was to make a mathematical model
p193
aVto see how they should be coupled
p194
aVto allow this transition between the two very different gaits.
p195
aVAnd we tested that on board of a robot.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd this is how it looks.
p198
aVSo what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot
p199
aVthat's completely controlled by our spinal cord model
p200
aVprogrammed on board of the robot.
p201
aVAnd the only thing we do
p202
aVis send to the robot through a remote control
p203
aVthe two descending signals it normally should receive
p204
aVfrom the upper part of the brain.
p205
aVAnd what's interesting is, by playing with these signals,
p206
aVwe can completely control speed, heading and type of gait.
p207
aVFor instance,
p208
aVwhen we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait,
p209
aVand at some point, if we stimulate a lot,
p210
aVvery rapidly it switches to the swimming gait.
p211
aVAnd finally, we can also do turning very nicely
p212
aVby just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other.
p213
aVAnd I think it's really beautiful
p214
aVhow nature has distributed control
p215
aVto really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord
p216
aVso that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle.
p217
aVIt just has to worry about this high-level modulation,
p218
aVand it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics.
p221
aVSo this is another project
p222
aVwhere we studied cat biomechanics,
p223
aVand we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion.
p224
aVAnd we found three important criteria in the properties,
p225
aVbasically, of the limbs.
p226
aVThe first one is that a cat limb
p227
aVmore or less looks like a pantograph-like structure.
p228
aVSo a pantograph is a mechanical structure
p229
aVwhich keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel.
p230
aVSo a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit
p231
aVthe internal movement of the segments.
p232
aVA second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight.
p233
aVMost of the muscles are in the trunk,
p234
aVwhich is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia
p235
aVand can be moved very rapidly.
p236
aVThe last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb,
p237
aVso to handle impacts and forces.
p238
aVAnd this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
p241
aVSo this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot,
p242
aVand as you see, it's a cute little robot.
p243
aVIt looks a bit like a toy,
p244
aVbut it was really used as a scientific tool
p245
aVto investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
p246
aVSo you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight,
p247
aVand also very elastic,
p248
aVso you can easily press it down and it will not break.
p249
aVIt will just jump, in fact.
p250
aVAnd this very elastic property is also very important.
p251
aVAnd you also see a bit these properties
p252
aVof these three segments of the leg as pantograph.
p253
aa(lp254
VNow, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait
p255
aVis obtained purely in open loop,
p256
aVmeaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops.
p257
aVAnd that's interesting, because it means
p258
aVthat just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait,
p259
aVand that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion.
p260
aVTo the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion,
p261
aVas you will see in the next video,
p262
aVwhere we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step,
p263
aVand the robot will not fall over,
p264
aVwhich was a surprise for us.
p265
aVThis is a small perturbation.
p266
aVI was expecting the robot to immediately fall over,
p267
aVbecause there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop.
p268
aVBut no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait,
p269
aVand the robot doesn't fall over.
p270
aVObviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles,
p271
aVyou need the full control loops and reflexes and everything.
p272
aVBut what's important here is that just for small perturbation,
p273
aVthe mechanics are right.
p274
aVAnd I think this is a very important message
p275
aVfrom biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience,
p276
aVsaying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, how does this relate to human locomotion?
p279
aVClearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion,
p280
aVbut at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar
p281
aVto that of other vertebrates.
p282
aVAnd especially the spinal cord
p283
aVis also the key controller for locomotion in humans.
p284
aVThat's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord,
p285
aVthis has dramatic effects.
p286
aVThe person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.
p287
aVThis is because the brain loses this communication
p288
aVwith the spinal cord.
p289
aVEspecially, it loses this descending modulation
p290
aVto initiate and modulate locomotion.
p291
aVSo a big goal of neuroprosthetics
p292
aVis to be able to reactivate that communication
p293
aVusing electrical or chemical stimulations.
p294
aVAnd there are several teams in the world that do exactly that,
p295
aVespecially at EPFL.
p296
aVMy colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera,
p297
aVwith whom I collaborate.
p298
aa(lp299
VBut to do this properly, it's very important to understand
p300
aVhow the spinal cord works,
p301
aVhow it interacts with the body,
p302
aVand how the brain communicates with the spinal cord.
p303
aVThis is where the robots and models that I've presented today
p304
aVwill hopefully play a key role
p305
aVtowards these very important goals.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VBruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots
p312
aVthat do things like swim in pollution
p313
aVand measure the pollution while they swim.
p314
aVBut for this one,
p315
aVyou mentioned in your talk, like a side project,
p316
aVsearch and rescue,
p317
aVand it does have a camera on its nose.
p318
aa(lp319
VAuke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot \u2014
p320
aVWe have some spin-off projects
p321
aVwhere we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection,
p322
aVso this robot is now seeing you.
p323
aVAnd the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation
p324
aVlike a collapsed building or a building that is flooded,
p325
aVand this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,
p326
aVwhy not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk,
p327
aVwith a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors
p328
aVand possibly create a communication link with the survivor.
p329
aa(lp330
VBG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.
p331
aa(lp332
VAI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit,
p333
aVbecause here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack
p334
aVjust of being worried that this would feed on you.
p335
aVBut by changing the appearance and it making it more robust,
p336
aVI'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.
p337
aa(lp338
VBG: Thank you very much. Thank you and your team.
