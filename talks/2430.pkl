VOn January 26, 2013,
p5
aVa band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu
p6
aVon the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
p7
aVThere, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts
p8
aVwritten in Arabic and several African languages
p9
aVand ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine,
p10
aVincluding one book which records
p11
aVperhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction.
p12
aVUnknown in the West,
p13
aVthis was the collected wisdom of an entire continent,
p14
aVthe voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all.
p15
aVThe mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event,
p16
aVcalled the burning of the manuscripts
p17
aV"a crime against world cultural heritage."
p18
aVAnd he was right \u2014
p19
aVor he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.
p20
aa(lp21
VIn fact, just before,
p22
aVAfrican scholars had collected a random assortment of old books
p23
aVand left them out for the terrorists to burn.
p24
aVToday, the collection lies hidden in Bamako,
p25
aVthe capital of Mali,
p26
aVmoldering in the high humidity.
p27
aVWhat was rescued by ruse
p28
aVis now once again in jeopardy,
p29
aVthis time by climate.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world,
p32
aVare not the only places, or even the main places
p33
aVin which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture
p34
aVare in jeopardy.
p35
aVSeveral years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries
p36
aVand discovered that, at the barest minimum,
p37
aVthere are 60,000 manuscripts
p38
aVpre-1500
p39
aVthat are illegible because of water damage,
p40
aVfading, mold and chemical reagents.
p41
aVThe real number is likely double that,
p42
aVand that doesn't even count
p43
aVRenaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts
p44
aVand cultural heritage objects such as maps.
p45
aa(lp46
VWhat if there were a technology
p47
aVthat could recover these lost and unknown works?
p48
aVImagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands
p49
aVof previously unknown texts
p50
aVcould radically transform our knowledge of the past.
p51
aVImagine what unknown classics we would discover
p52
aVwhich would rewrite the canons of literature, history,
p53
aVphilosophy, music \u2014
p54
aVor, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities,
p55
aVbuilding new bridges between people and culture.
p56
aVThese are the questions that transformed me
p57
aVfrom a medieval scholar, a reader of texts,
p58
aVinto a textual scientist.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhat an unsatisfying word "reader" is.
p61
aVFor me, it conjures up images of passivity,
p62
aVof someone sitting idly in an armchair
p63
aVwaiting for knowledge to come to him
p64
aVin a neat little parcel.
p65
aVHow much better to be a participant in the past,
p66
aVan adventurer in an undiscovered country,
p67
aVsearching for the hidden text.
p68
aVAs an academic, I was a mere reader.
p69
aVI read and taught the same classics
p70
aVthat people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years \u2014
p71
aVVirgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch \u2014
p72
aVand with every scholarly article that I published
p73
aVI added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.
p74
aVWhat I wanted to be
p75
aVwas an archaeologist of the past,
p76
aVa discoverer of literature,
p77
aVan Indiana Jones without the whip \u2014
p78
aVor, actually, with the whip.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aVAnd I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career.
p84
aVAt the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love,"
p85
aVthe last important long poem of the European Middle Ages
p86
aVnever to have been edited.
p87
aVAnd it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript
p88
aVwhich was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden
p89
aVin World War II
p90
aVthat generations of scholars had pronounced it lost.
p91
aVFor five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp
p92
aVtrying to recover traces of the writing
p93
aVand I'd gone about as far as technology at the time
p94
aVcould actually take me.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd so I did what many people do.
p97
aVI went online,
p98
aVand there I learned about
p99
aVhow multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises
p100
aVof the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes
p101
aVfrom a 13th-century palimpsest.
p102
aVA palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd so, out of the blue,
p105
aVI decided to write to the lead imaging scientist
p106
aVon the Archimedes palimpsest project,
p107
aVProfessor Roger Easton,
p108
aVwith a plan and a plea.
p109
aVAnd to my surprise, he actually wrote back.
p110
aVWith his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government
p111
aVto build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab,
p112
aVAnd with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess
p113
aVinto a new medieval classic.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo how does multispectral imaging actually work?
p116
aVWell, the idea behind multispectral imaging
p117
aVis something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles
p118
aVwill immediately appreciate:
p119
aVthat what we can see in the visible spectrum of light
p120
aVis only a tiny fraction of what's actually there.
p121
aVThe same is true with invisible writing.
p122
aVOur system uses 12 wavelengths of light
p123
aVbetween the ultraviolet and the infrared,
p124
aVand these are shown down onto the manuscript from above
p125
aVfrom banks of LEDs,
p126
aVand another multispectral light source
p127
aVwhich comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript.
p128
aVUp to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way
p129
aVusing a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens
p130
aVwhich is made out of quartz.
p131
aVThere are about five of these in the world.
p132
aVAnd once we capture these images,
p133
aVwe feed them through statistical algorithms
p134
aVto further enhance and clarify them,
p135
aVusing software which was originally designed for satellite images
p136
aVand used by people like geospatial scientists
p137
aVand the CIA.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe results can be spectacular.
p140
aVYou may already have heard of what's been done
p141
aVfor the Dead Sea Scrolls,
p142
aVwhich are slowly gelatinizing.
p143
aVUsing infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners
p144
aVof the Dead Sea Scrolls.
p145
aVYou may not be aware, however,
p146
aVof other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.
p147
aa(lp148
VHere, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript
p149
aVthat we imaged,
p150
aVwhich is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world.
p151
aVThe Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin,
p152
aVand it dates from the first half of the fourth century.
p153
aVThis is the closest we can come
p154
aVto the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom
p155
aVunder Emperor Constantine,
p156
aVand at the time also of the Council of Nicaea,
p157
aVwhen the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon.
p158
aVThis manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged,
p159
aVand it's damaged because for centuries
p160
aVit had been used and handled
p161
aVin swearing in ceremonies in the church.
p162
aVIn fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner
p163
aVis Aspergillus, which is a fungus
p164
aVwhich originates in the unwashed hands
p165
aVof a person with tuberculosis.
p166
aVOur imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription
p167
aVof this manuscript in 250 years.
p168
aa(lp169
VHaving a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however,
p170
aVis only part of the solution.
p171
aVThe technology is expensive and very rare,
p172
aVand the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric.
p173
aVThat means that mounting recoveries
p174
aVis beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions.
p175
aVThat's why I founded the Lazarus Project,
p176
aVa not-for-profit initiative
p177
aVto bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers
p178
aVand smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever.
p179
aVOver the past five years,
p180
aVour team of imaging scientists, scholars and students
p181
aVhas travelled to seven different countries
p182
aVand have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts,
p183
aVincluded the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English,
p184
aVthe Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh,
p185
aVand some of the most valuable earliest Gospels
p186
aVlocated in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, spectral imaging can recover lost texts.
p189
aVMore subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object,
p190
aVthe story of how, when and by whom a text was created,
p191
aVand, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote.
p192
aVTake, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence
p193
aVwritten in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,
p194
aVwhich some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago
p195
aVat the Library of Congress.
p196
aVCurators had noticed that one word throughout
p197
aVhad been scratched out and overwritten.
p198
aVThe word overwritten was "citizens."
p199
aVPerhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.
p200
aV"Subjects."
p201
aVThere, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy
p202
aVevolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.
p203
aa(lp204
VOr consider the 1491 Martellus Map,
p205
aVwhich we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library.
p206
aVThis was the map that Columbus likely consulted
p207
aVbefore he traveled to the New World
p208
aVand which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like
p209
aVand where Japan was located.
p210
aVThe problem with this map is that its inks and pigments
p211
aVhad so degraded over time
p212
aVthat this large, nearly seven-foot map,
p213
aVmade the world look like a giant desert.
p214
aVUntil now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is,
p215
aVof what Columbus knew of the world
p216
aVand how world cultures were represented.
p217
aVThe main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light.
p218
aVUltraviolet did very little for it.
p219
aVMultispectral gave us everything.
p220
aVIn Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long
p221
aVthat they could cover the creature's entire body.
p222
aVIn Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke.
p223
aVLike starlight, which can convey images
p224
aVof the way the Universe looked in the distant past,
p225
aVso multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments
p226
aVof an object's creation.
p227
aVThrough this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind,
p228
aVthe naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,
p229
aVthe imperfections of the human imagination
p230
aVthat allow these hallowed objects and their authors
p231
aVto become more real,
p232
aVthat make history closer to us.
p233
aa(lp234
VWhat about the future?
p235
aVThere's so much of the past,
p236
aVand so few people with the skills to rescue it
p237
aVbefore these objects disappear forever.
p238
aVThat's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline
p239
aVthat I call "textual science."
p240
aVTextual science is a marriage
p241
aVof the traditional skills of a literary scholar \u2014
p242
aVthe ability to read old languages and old handwriting,
p243
aVthe knowledge of how texts are made
p244
aVin order to be able to place and date them \u2014
p245
aVwith new techniques like imaging science,
p246
aVthe chemistry of inks and pigments,
p247
aVcomputer-aided optical character recognition.
p248
aa(lp249
VLast year, a student in my class,
p250
aVa freshman,
p251
aVwith a background in Latin and Greek,
p252
aVwas image-processing a palimpsest
p253
aVthat we had photographed at a famous library in Rome.
p254
aVAs he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text.
p255
aVEveryone gathered around,
p256
aVand he read a line from a lost work
p257
aVof the Greek comic dramatist Menander.
p258
aVThis was the first time in well over a thousand years
p259
aVthat those words had been pronounced aloud.
p260
aVIn that moment, he became a scholar.
p261
aa(lp262
VLadies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you very much.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)
