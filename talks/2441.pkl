VI was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme,
p5
aVand then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify.
p10
aVAnd I have some bad news,
p11
aVbut I have a lot more good news.
p12
aVI'm going to propose three questions
p13
aVand the answer to the first one
p14
aVnecessarily involves a little bad news.
p15
aVBut \u2014 hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions
p16
aVreally are very positive.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo the first question is, "Do we really have to change?"
p19
aVAnd of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things
p20
aVchanged the environmental movement,
p21
aVreally launched the modern environmental movement.
p22
aV18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth,
p23
aVthe first Earth Day was organized.
p24
aVAnd we learned a lot about ourselves
p25
aVlooking back at our planet from space.
p26
aVAnd one of the things that we learned
p27
aVconfirmed what the scientists have long told us.
p28
aVOne of the most essential facts
p29
aVabout the climate crisis has to do with the sky.
p30
aVAs this picture illustrates,
p31
aVthe sky is not the vast and limitless expanse
p32
aVthat appears when we look up from the ground.
p33
aVIt is a very thin shell of atmosphere
p34
aVsurrounding the planet.
p35
aVThat right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization
p36
aVas it's currently organized.
p37
aVWe are spewing 110 million tons
p38
aVof heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours,
p39
aVfree of charge, go ahead.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd there are many sources of the greenhouse gases,
p42
aVI'm certainly not going to go through them all.
p43
aVI'm going to focus on the main one,
p44
aVbut agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved.
p45
aVManagement of forests, transportation,
p46
aVthe oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
p47
aVBut I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem,
p48
aVwhich is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels
p49
aVfor 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year.
p50
aVAnd you can see from this image that after World War II,
p51
aVthe emission rates started really accelerating.
p52
aVAnd the accumulated amount of man-made, global warming pollution
p53
aVthat is up in the atmosphere now
p54
aVtraps as much extra heat energy as would be released
p55
aVby 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding
p56
aVevery 24 hours, 365 days a year.
p57
aVFact-checked over and over again,
p58
aVconservative, it's the truth.
p59
aVNow it's a big planet, but \u2014
p60
aa(lp61
V(Explosion sound)
p62
aa(lp63
Vthat is a lot of energy,
p64
aVparticularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day.
p65
aVAnd all that extra heat energy
p66
aVis heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system.
p67
aa(lp68
VLet's look at the atmosphere.
p69
aVThis is a depiction
p70
aVof what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures.
p71
aVThe white represents normal temperature days;
p72
aV1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.
p73
aVThe blue are cooler than average days,
p74
aVthe red are warmer than average days.
p75
aVBut the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s.
p76
aVAnd you'll see in the lower right-hand corner
p77
aVthe appearance of statistically significant numbers
p78
aVof extremely hot days.
p79
aVIn the 90s, the curve shifted further.
p80
aVAnd in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days
p81
aVare now more numerous than the cooler than average days.
p82
aVIn fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth
p83
aVthan they were just 30 years ago.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo we're having record-breaking temperatures.
p86
aVFourteen of the 15 of the hottest years ever measured with instruments
p87
aVhave been in this young century.
p88
aVThe hottest of all was last year.
p89
aVLast month was the 371st month in a row
p90
aVwarmer than the 20th-century average.
p91
aVAnd for the first time, not only the warmest January,
p92
aVbut for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer
p93
aVthan the average.
p94
aVThese higher temperatures are having an effect on animals,
p95
aVplants, people, ecosystems.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut on a global basis, 93 percent of all the extra heat energy
p98
aVis trapped in the oceans.
p99
aVAnd the scientists can measure the heat buildup
p100
aVmuch more precisely now
p101
aVat all depths: deep, mid-ocean,
p102
aVthe first few hundred meters.
p103
aVAnd this, too, is accelerating.
p104
aVIt goes back more than a century.
p105
aVAnd more than half of the increase has been in the last 19 years.
p106
aVThis has consequences.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe first order of consequence:
p109
aVthe ocean-based storms get stronger.
p110
aVSuper Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific
p111
aVfive and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal
p112
aVbefore it slammed into Tacloban,
p113
aVas the most destructive storm ever to make landfall.
p114
aVPope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue,
p115
aVvisited Tacloban right after that.
p116
aVSuperstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic
p117
aVnine degrees warmer than normal
p118
aVbefore slamming into New York and New Jersey.
p119
aVThe second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now.
p120
aVThe warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies.
p121
aVAverage humidity worldwide has gone up four percent.
p122
aVAnd it creates these atmospheric rivers.
p123
aVThe Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers."
p124
aVAnd they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land
p125
aVwhere storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours.
p126
aVThis is from Montana.
p127
aVTake a look at this storm last August.
p128
aVAs it moves over Tucson, Arizona.
p129
aVIt literally splashes off the city.
p130
aVThese downpours are really unusual.
p131
aa(lp132
VLast July in Houston, Texas,
p133
aVit rained for two days, 162 billion gallons.
p134
aVThat represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls
p135
aVin the middle of the city,
p136
aVwhich was, of course, paralyzed.
p137
aVThese record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis one is from Chile last year.
p140
aVAnd you'll see that warehouse going by.
p141
aVThere are oil tankers cars going by.
p142
aVThis is from Spain last September,
p143
aVyou could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess.
p144
aVEvery night on the TV news now is like a nature hike
p145
aVthrough the Book of Revelation.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VI mean, really.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe insurance industry has certainly noticed,
p152
aVthe losses have been mounting up.
p153
aVThey're not under any illusions about what's happening.
p154
aVAnd the causality requires a moment of discussion.
p155
aVWe're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect \u2014
p156
aVone cause, one effect.
p157
aVThis is systemic causation.
p158
aVAs the great Kevin Trenberth says,
p159
aV"All storms are different now.
p160
aVThere's so much extra energy in the atmosphere,
p161
aVthere's so much extra water vapor.
p162
aVEvery storm is different now."
p163
aVSo, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground
p164
aVand causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts
p165
aVand many of them are underway right now.
p166
aa(lp167
VIt dries out the vegetation
p168
aVand causes more fires in the western part of North America.
p169
aVThere's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them.
p170
aa(lp171
VMore lightning,
p172
aVas the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount
p173
aVof additional lightning also.
p174
aa(lp175
VThese climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences
p176
aVand create instability.
p177
aVThe climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006
p178
aVdestroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria,
p179
aVkilled 80 percent of the livestock,
p180
aVand drove 1.5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria,
p181
aVwhere they collided with another 1.5 million refugees
p182
aVfrom the Iraq War.
p183
aVAnd along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell
p184
aVthat people are trying to close now.
p185
aVThe US Defense Department has long warned
p186
aVof consequences from the climate crisis,
p187
aVincluding refugees, food and water shortages
p188
aVand pandemic disease.
p189
aa(lp190
VRight now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread
p191
aVto the higher latitudes;
p192
aVthe transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this.
p193
aVBut the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas
p194
aVwhere these microbial diseases can become endemic
p195
aVand change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.
p196
aVThe Zika epidemic now \u2014
p197
aVwe're better positioned in North America
p198
aVbecause it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system.
p199
aVBut when women in some regions of South and Central America
p200
aVare advised not to get pregnant for two years \u2014
p201
aVthat's something new, that ought to get our attention.
p202
aVThe Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world,
p203
aVlast summer labeled this a medical emergency now.
p204
aVAnd there are many factors because of it.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is also connected to the extinction crisis.
p207
aVWe're in danger of losing 50 percent of all the living species on earth
p208
aVby the end of this century.
p209
aVAnd already, land-based plants and animals
p210
aVare now moving towards the poles
p211
aVat an average rate of 15 feet per day.
p212
aa(lp213
VSpeaking of the North Pole,
p214
aVlast December 29, the same storm that caused historic flooding
p215
aVin the American Midwest,
p216
aVraised temperatures at the North Pole
p217
aV50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal,
p218
aVcausing the thawing of the North Pole
p219
aVin the middle of the long, dark, winter, polar night.
p220
aVAnd when the land-based ice of the Arctic melts,
p221
aVit raises sea level.
p222
aa(lp223
VPaul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this.
p224
aVIt's more dangerous coming off Greenland
p225
aVand particularly, Antarctica.
p226
aVThe 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population
p227
aVare mostly in South and Southeast Asia.
p228
aVWhen you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami:
p229
aVthree and a half trillion dollars at risk.
p230
aVNumber three: New York and Newark.
p231
aVI was in Miami last fall during the supermoon,
p232
aVone of the highest high-tide days.
p233
aVAnd there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets
p234
aVof Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale
p235
aVand Del Rey.
p236
aVAnd this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now.
p237
aVNot with rain \u2014 they call it "sunny-day flooding."
p238
aVIt comes up through the storm sewers.
p239
aVAnd the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says
p240
aVit is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens.
p241
aVThis is a crisis that's getting worse day by day.
p242
aVWe have to move beyond partisanship.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans \u2014
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
Vwho had the courage last fall
p249
aVto step out and take a political risk,
p250
aVby telling the truth about the climate crisis.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up,
p253
aVthere are many of these aspects I haven't even mentioned.
p254
aVIt's an enormous burden.
p255
aVI'll mention just one more,
p256
aVbecause the World Economic Forum last month in Davos,
p257
aVafter their annual survey of 750 economists,
p258
aVsaid the climate crisis is now the number one risk
p259
aVto the global economy.
p260
aVSo you get central bankers
p261
aVlike Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank,
p262
aVsaying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable.
p263
aVSubprime carbon.
p264
aVI'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages,
p265
aVbut it's the same thing.
p266
aVIf you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned
p267
aVsince the beginning of the industrial revolution,
p268
aVthis is the quantity burned in the last 16 years.
p269
aVHere are all the ones that are proven and left on the books,
p270
aV28 trillion dollars.
p271
aVThe International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned.
p272
aVSo the rest, 22 trillion dollars \u2014
p273
aVunburnable.
p274
aVRisk to the global economy.
p275
aVThat's why divestment movement makes practical sense
p276
aVand is not just a moral imperative.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo the answer to the first question, "Must we change?"
p279
aVis yes, we have to change.
p280
aVSecond question, "Can we change?"
p281
aVThis is the exciting news!
p282
aVThe best projections in the world 16 years ago
p283
aVwere that by 2010, the world would be able to install
p284
aV30 gigawatts of wind capacity.
p285
aVWe beat that mark by 14 and a half times over.
p286
aVWe see an exponential curve for wind installations now.
p287
aVWe see the cost coming down dramatically.
p288
aVSome countries \u2014 take Germany, an industrial powerhouse
p289
aVwith a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way \u2014
p290
aVone day last December,
p291
aVgot 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources,
p292
aVmainly solar and wind.
p293
aVA lot of countries are getting more than half on an average basis.
p294
aa(lp295
VMore good news:
p296
aVenergy storage, from batteries particularly,
p297
aVis now beginning to take off
p298
aVbecause the cost has been coming down very dramatically
p299
aVto solve the intermittency problem.
p300
aVWith solar, the news is even more exciting!
p301
aVThe best projections 14 years ago were that we would install
p302
aVone gigawatt per year by 2010.
p303
aVWhen 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over.
p304
aVLast year, we beat it by 58 times over.
p305
aVThis year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over.
p306
aa(lp307
VWe're going to win this.
p308
aVWe are going to prevail.
p309
aVThe exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic.
p310
aVWhen I came to this stage 10 years ago,
p311
aVthis is where it was.
p312
aVWe have seen a revolutionary breakthrough
p313
aVin the emergence of these exponential curves.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd the cost has come down 10 percent per year
p318
aVfor 30 years.
p319
aVAnd it's continuing to come down.
p320
aa(lp321
VNow, the business community has certainly noticed this,
p322
aVbecause it's crossing the grid parity point.
p323
aVCheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise.
p324
aVGrid parity is understood as that line, that threshold,
p325
aVbelow which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity
p326
aVfrom burning fossil fuels.
p327
aVThat threshold is a little bit like the difference
p328
aVbetween 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,
p329
aVor zero and one Celsius.
p330
aVIt's a difference of more than one degree,
p331
aVit's the difference between ice and water.
p332
aVAnd it's the difference between markets that are frozen up,
p333
aVand liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment.
p334
aVThis is the biggest new business opportunity
p335
aVin the history of the world,
p336
aVand two-thirds of it is in the private sector.
p337
aVWe are seeing an explosion of new investment.
p338
aVStarting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation
p339
aVsurpassed fossils.
p340
aVThe gap has been growing ever since.
p341
aVThe projections for the future are even more dramatic,
p342
aVeven though fossil energy is now still subsidized
p343
aVat a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
p344
aVAnd by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here,
p345
aVparticularly if you assume that the work many are doing
p346
aVto try to break through to safer and more acceptable,
p347
aVmore affordable forms of nuclear,
p348
aVthis could change even more dramatically.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption
p351
aVof a new technology?
p352
aVWell, there are many, but let's look at cell phones.
p353
aVIn 1980, AT&T, then Ma Bell,
p354
aVcommissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey
p355
aVof those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then.
p356
aV"How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked.
p357
aVMcKinsey came back and said, "900,000."
p358
aVAnd sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived,
p359
aVthey did sell 900,000 \u2014 in the first three days.
p360
aVAnd for the balance of the year, they sold 120 times more.
p361
aVAnd now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong?
p364
aVI've asked that question myself, "Why?"
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
VAnd I think the answer is in three parts.
p369
aVFirst, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected,
p370
aVeven as the quality went up.
p371
aVAnd low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid \u2014
p372
aVthey leap-frogged to the new technology.
p373
aVThe big expansion has been in the developing counties.
p374
aVSo what about the electricity grids in the developing world?
p375
aVWell, not so hot.
p376
aVAnd in many areas, they don't exist.
p377
aVThere are more people without any electricity at all in India
p378
aVthan the entire population of the United States of America.
p379
aVSo now we're getting this:
p380
aVsolar panels on grass huts
p381
aVand new business models that make it affordable.
p382
aVMuhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.
p383
aVThis is a village market.
p384
aVBangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world:
p385
aVtwo systems per minute on average, night and day.
p386
aVAnd we have all we need:
p387
aVenough energy from the Sun comes to the earth
p388
aVevery hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year.
p389
aVIt's actually a little bit less than an hour.
p390
aVSo the answer to the second question, "Can we change?"
p391
aVis clearly "Yes."
p392
aVAnd it's an ever-firmer "yes."
p393
aa(lp394
VLast question, "Will we change?"
p395
aVParis really was a breakthrough,
p396
aVsome of the provisions are binding
p397
aVand the regular reviews will matter a lot.
p398
aVBut nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead.
p399
aVChina has already announced that starting next year,
p400
aVthey're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system.
p401
aVThey will likely link up with the European Union.
p402
aVThe United States has already been changing.
p403
aVAll of these coal plants were proposed
p404
aVin the next 10 years and canceled.
p405
aVAll of these existing coal plants were retired.
p406
aVAll of these coal plants have had their retirement announced.
p407
aVAll of them \u2014 canceled.
p408
aVWe are moving forward.
p409
aVLast year \u2014 if you look at all of the investment
p410
aVin new electricity generation in the United States,
p411
aValmost three-quarters was from renewable energy,
p412
aVmostly wind and solar.
p413
aa(lp414
VWe are solving this crisis.
p415
aVThe only question is: how long will it take to get there?
p416
aVSo, it matters that a lot of people are organizing
p417
aVto insist on this change.
p418
aVAlmost 400,000 people marched in New York City
p419
aVbefore the UN special session on this.
p420
aVMany thousands, tens of thousands,
p421
aVmarched in cities around the world.
p422
aVAnd so, I am extremely optimistic.
p423
aVAs I said before, we are going to win this.
p424
aa(lp425
VI'll finish with this story.
p426
aVWhen I was 13 years old,
p427
aVI heard that proposal by President Kennedy
p428
aVto land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely
p429
aVin 10 years.
p430
aVAnd I heard adults of that day and time say,
p431
aV"That's reckless, expensive, may well fail."
p432
aVBut eight years and two months later,
p433
aVin the moment that Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon,
p434
aVthere was great cheer that went up in NASA's mission control in Houston.
p435
aVHere's a little-known fact about that:
p436
aVthe average age of the systems engineers,
p437
aVthe controllers in the room that day, was 26,
p438
aVwhich means, among other things,
p439
aVtheir age, when they heard that challenge, was 18.
p440
aa(lp441
VWe now have a moral challenge
p442
aVthat is in the tradition of others that we have faced.
p443
aVOne of the greatest poets of the last century in the US,
p444
aVWallace Stevens,
p445
aVwrote a line that has stayed with me:
p446
aV"After the final 'no,' there comes a 'yes,'
p447
aVand on that 'yes', the future world depends."
p448
aVWhen the abolitionists started their movement,
p449
aVthey met with no after no after no.
p450
aVAnd then came a yes.
p451
aVThe Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement
p452
aVmet endless no's, until finally, there was a yes.
p453
aVThe Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid,
p454
aVand more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights
p455
aVhere in the United States and elsewhere.
p456
aVAfter the final "no" comes a "yes."
p457
aa(lp458
VWhen any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved
p459
aVinto a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong,
p460
aVthe outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings.
p461
aVNinety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now
p462
aVand it is why we're going to win this.
p463
aVWe have everything we need.
p464
aVSome still doubt that we have the will to act,
p465
aVbut I say the will to act is itself a renewable resource.
p466
aa(lp467
VThank you very much.
p468
aa(lp469
V(Applause)
p470
aa(lp471
VChris Anderson: You've got this incredible combination of skills.
p472
aVYou've got this scientist mind that can understand
p473
aVthe full range of issues,
p474
aVand the ability to turn it into the most vivid language.
p475
aVNo one else can do that, that's why you led this thing.
p476
aVIt was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now.
p477
aa(lp478
VAl Gore: Well, you're nice to say that, Chris.
p479
aVBut honestly, I have a lot of really good friends
p480
aVin the scientific community who are incredibly patient
p481
aVand who will sit there and explain this stuff to me
p482
aVover and over and over again
p483
aVuntil I can get it into simple enough language
p484
aVthat I can understand it.
p485
aVAnd that's the key to trying to communicate.
p486
aa(lp487
VCA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,
p488
aVsecond part: incredibly hopeful.
p489
aVHow do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough
p490
aVto solve what you showed in the first part?
p491
aa(lp492
VAG: I think that the crossing \u2014
p493
aVyou know, I've only been in the business world for 15 years.
p494
aVBut one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters
p495
aVif a new product or service is more expensive
p496
aVthan the incumbent, or cheaper than.
p497
aVTurns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than.
p498
aa(lp499
V(Laughter)
p500
aa(lp501
VAnd when it crosses that line,
p502
aVthen a lot of things really change.
p503
aVWe are regularly surprised by these developments.
p504
aVThe late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said,
p505
aV"Things take longer to happen then you think they will,
p506
aVand then they happen much faster than you thought they could."
p507
aVI really think that's where we are.
p508
aVSome people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now,
p509
aVmeaning when it gets below the grid parity,
p510
aVunsubsidized in most places,
p511
aVthen it's the default choice.
p512
aa(lp513
VNow, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing,
p514
aVthere is an effort to use regulations to slow this down.
p515
aVAnd I just don't think it's going to work.
p516
aa(lp517
VThere's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,
p518
aVwho's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party.
p519
aVThey enlisted her in this effort to put a tax
p520
aVon solar panels and regulations.
p521
aVAnd she had just put solar panels on her roof
p522
aVand she didn't understand the request.
p523
aa(lp524
V(Laughter)
p525
aa(lp526
VAnd so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club
p527
aVand they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party.
p528
aa(lp529
V(Laughter)
p530
aa(lp531
V(Applause)
p532
aa(lp533
VAnd they defeated the proposal.
p534
aVSo, finally, the answer to your question is,
p535
aVthis sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché,
p536
aVbut 10 years ago \u2014 and Christiana referred to this \u2014
p537
aVthere are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role
p538
aVin generating those exponential curves.
p539
aVAnd it didn't work out economically for some of them,
p540
aVbut it kick-started this global revolution.
p541
aVAnd what people in this audience do now
p542
aVwith the knowledge that we are going to win this.
p543
aVBut it matters a lot how fast we win it.
p544
aa(lp545
VCA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.
p546
aVIf this turns out to be the year,
p547
aVthat the partisan thing changes,
p548
aVas you said, it's no longer a partisan issue,
p549
aVbut you bring along people from the other side together,
p550
aVbacked by science, backed by these kinds of investment opportunities,
p551
aVbacked by reason that you win the day \u2014
p552
aVboy, that's really exciting.
p553
aa(lp554
VThank you so much.
p555
aa(lp556
VAG: Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED.
p557
aVThank you!
