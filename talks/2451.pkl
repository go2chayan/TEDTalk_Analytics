VThere we were,
p5
aVsouls and bodies packed into a Texas church
p6
aVon the last night of our lives.
p7
aVPacked into a room just like this,
p8
aVbut with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric,
p9
aVwith an organ to my left and a choir at my back
p10
aVand a baptism pool built into the wall behind them.
p11
aVA room like this, nonetheless.
p12
aVWith the same great feelings of suspense,
p13
aVthe same deep hopes for salvation,
p14
aVthe same sweat in the palms
p15
aVand the same people in the back not paying attention.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VThis was December 31, 1999,
p20
aVthe night of the Second Coming of Christ,
p21
aVand the end of the world as I knew it.
p22
aVI had turned 12 that year
p23
aVand had reached the age of accountability.
p24
aVAnd once I stopped complaining
p25
aVabout how unfair it was that Jesus would return
p26
aVas soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done,
p27
aVI figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo I went to church as often as I could.
p30
aVI listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise,
p31
aVtrying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me
p32
aVand decided to come back early.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd just in case he did,
p35
aVI built a backup plan,
p36
aVby reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time.
p37
aVAnd I found in their pages
p38
aVthat if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight,
p39
aVI had another shot.
p40
aVAll I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast,
p41
aVfight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.
p42
aVIt would be hard \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
Vbut I knew I could do it.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VBut planning time was over now.
p51
aVIt was 11:50pm.
p52
aVWe had 10 minutes left,
p53
aVand my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar
p54
aVbecause he wanted to be praying when midnight struck.
p55
aVSo every faction of the congregation
p56
aVtook its place.
p57
aVThe choir stayed in the choir stand,
p58
aVthe deacons and their wives \u2014
p59
aVor the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them \u2014
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
Vtook first position in front of the altar.
p64
aVYou see, in America,
p65
aVeven the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
V(Applause)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie
p72
aVwere the elderly \u2014
p73
aVthese men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns
p74
aVin the cotton fields of East Texas,
p75
aVand whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown,
p76
aVjust like the clay of East Texas,
p77
aVand whose hopes and dreams for what life might become
p78
aVoutside of East Texas
p79
aVhad sometimes been bent and broken
p80
aVeven further than their backs.
p81
aa(lp82
VYes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
p83
aVThey had waited their whole lives for this moment,
p84
aVjust as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world,
p85
aVand just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show
p86
aVto come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock.
p87
aVAnd as she made her way to the altar,
p88
aVI snuck right in behind her,
p89
aVbecause I knew for sure
p90
aVthat my grandmother was going to heaven.
p91
aVAnd I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer,
p92
aVI might go right on with her.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo I held on
p95
aVand I closed my eyes
p96
aVto listen,
p97
aVto wait.
p98
aVAnd the prayers got louder.
p99
aVAnd the shouts of response to the call of the prayer
p100
aVwent up higher even still.
p101
aVAnd the organ rolled on in to add the dirge.
p102
aVAnd the heat came on to add to the sweat.
p103
aVAnd my hand gripped firmer,
p104
aVso I wouldn't be the one left in the field.
p105
aVMy eyes clenched tighter
p106
aVso I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff.
p107
aVAnd then a voice rang out above us:
p108
aV"Amen."
p109
aa(lp110
VIt was over.
p111
aVI looked at the clock.
p112
aVIt was after midnight.
p113
aVI looked at the elder believers
p114
aVwhose savior had not come,
p115
aVwho were too proud to show any signs of disappointment,
p116
aVwho had believed too much and for too long
p117
aVto start doubting now.
p118
aVBut I was upset on their behalf.
p119
aVThey had been duped,
p120
aVhoodwinked, bamboozled,
p121
aVand I had gone right along with them.
p122
aVI had prayed their prayers,
p123
aVI had yielded not to temptation as best I could.
p124
aVI had dipped my head not once, but twice
p125
aVin that snot-inducing baptism pool.
p126
aVI had believed.
p127
aVNow what?
p128
aa(lp129
VI got home just in time to turn on the television
p130
aVand watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium
p131
aVas it rolled in around the world.
p132
aVIt struck me that it would have been strange anyway,
p133
aVfor Jesus to come back again and again
p134
aVbased on the different time zones.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd this made me feel even more ridiculous \u2014
p139
aVhurt, really.
p140
aVBut there on that night, I did not stop believing.
p141
aVI just believed a new thing:
p142
aVthat it was possible not to believe.
p143
aVIt was possible the answers I had were wrong,
p144
aVthat the questions themselves were wrong.
p145
aVAnd now, where there was once a mountain of certitude,
p146
aVthere was, running right down to its foundation,
p147
aVa spring of doubt,
p148
aVa spring that promised rivers.
p149
aa(lp150
VI can trace the whole drama of my life
p151
aVback to that night in that church
p152
aVwhen my savior did not come for me;
p153
aVwhen the thing I believed most certainly
p154
aVturned out to be, if not a lie,
p155
aVthen not quite the truth.
p156
aVAnd even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way,
p157
aVI'm convinced that you are here
p158
aVbecause some part of you has done the same thing that I have done
p159
aVsince the dawn of this new century,
p160
aVsince my mother left and my father stayed away
p161
aVand my Lord refused to come.
p162
aVAnd I held out my hand,
p163
aVreaching for something to believe in.
p164
aa(lp165
VI held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,
p166
aVwith the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas
p167
aVwas a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known,
p168
aVthe broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
p169
aVBut when I found myself back home one winter break,
p170
aVwith my face planted in the floor,
p171
aVmy hands tied behind my back
p172
aVand a burglar's gun pressed to my head,
p173
aVI knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
p174
aa(lp175
VI held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers
p176
aVas an intern in 2008.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VSo hopeful \u2014
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
Vthat I called home to inform my family
p185
aVthat we'd never be poor again.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VBut as I witnessed this temple of finance
p190
aVcome crashing down before my eyes,
p191
aVI knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
p192
aa(lp193
VI held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer,
p194
aVwho had heard a voice call out from Illinois,
p195
aVsaying, "It's been a long time coming,
p196
aVbut in this election, change has come to America."
p197
aVBut as the Congress ground to a halt
p198
aVand the country ripped at the seams
p199
aVand hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke,
p200
aVI knew that even the political second coming
p201
aVcould not save me.
p202
aa(lp203
VI had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream,
p204
aVpraying to the gods of my time
p205
aVof success,
p206
aVand money,
p207
aVand power.
p208
aVBut over and over again,
p209
aVmidnight struck, and I opened my eyes
p210
aVto see that all of these gods were dead.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd from that graveyard,
p213
aVI began the search once more,
p214
aVnot because I was brave,
p215
aVbut because I knew that I would either believe
p216
aVor I would die.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca,
p219
aVHarvard Business School \u2014
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
Vthis time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation
p224
aVthat it claimed to offer.
p225
aVNo, I knew there'd be more work to do.
p226
aa(lp227
VThe work began in the dark corner of a crowded party,
p228
aVin the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter,
p229
aVwhen three friends and I asked a question
p230
aVthat young folks searching for something real have asked
p231
aVfor a very long time:
p232
aV"What if we took a road trip?"
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VWe didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there,
p237
aVbut we knew we had to do it.
p238
aVBecause all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote,
p239
aVto "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere,"
p240
aVand go find out what everybody was doing
p241
aVall over the country.
p242
aVSo even though there were other voices who said
p243
aVthat the risk was too great and the proof too thin,
p244
aVwe went on anyhow.
p245
aa(lp246
VWe went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013,
p247
aVthrough the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit,
p248
aVthrough the swamps of New Orleans,
p249
aVwhere we found and worked with men and women
p250
aVwho were building small businesses
p251
aVthat made purpose their bottom line.
p252
aVAnd having been trained at the West Point of capitalism,
p253
aVthis struck us as a revolutionary idea.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd this idea spread,
p258
aVgrowing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America,
p259
aVa movement that landed me here on this stage today.
p260
aVIt spread because we found a great hunger in our generation
p261
aVfor purpose, for meaning.
p262
aVIt spread because we found countless entrepreneurs
p263
aVin the nooks and crannies of America
p264
aVwho were creating jobs and changing lives
p265
aVand who needed a little help.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut if I'm being honest, it also spread
p268
aVbecause I fought to spread it.
p269
aVThere was no length to which I would not go
p270
aVto preach this gospel,
p271
aVto get more people to believe
p272
aVthat we could bind the wounds of a broken country,
p273
aVone social business at a time.
p274
aVBut it was this journey of evangelism
p275
aVthat led me to the rather different gospel
p276
aVthat I've come to share with you today.
p277
aa(lp278
VIt began one evening almost a year ago
p279
aVat the Museum of Natural History in New York City,
p280
aVat a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
p281
aVUnder a full-size replica of a whale,
p282
aVI sat with the titans of our time
p283
aVas they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
p284
aVThere was pride in a room
p285
aVwhere net worth and assets under management
p286
aVsurpassed half a trillion dollars.
p287
aVWe looked over all that we had made,
p288
aVand it was good.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VBut it just so happened,
p293
aVtwo days later,
p294
aVI had to travel up the road to Harlem,
p295
aVwhere I found myself sitting in an urban farm
p296
aVthat had once been a vacant lot,
p297
aVlistening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids
p298
aVthat showed up there every day.
p299
aVAll of them lived below the poverty line.
p300
aVMany of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack
p301
aVto avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
p302
aVSome of them came to Tony's program,
p303
aVcalled Harlem Grown,
p304
aVto get the only meal they had each day.
p305
aVTony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension,
p306
aVafter 20 years as a cab driver.
p307
aVHe told me that he didn't give himself a salary,
p308
aVbecause despite success, the program struggled for resources.
p309
aVHe told me that he would take any help
p310
aVthat he could get.
p311
aVAnd I was there as that help.
p312
aa(lp313
VBut as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears
p314
aVwelling up in my eyes.
p315
aVI felt the weight of revelation
p316
aVthat I could sit in one room on one night,
p317
aVwhere a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars,
p318
aVand another room, two days later,
p319
aVjust 50 blocks up the road,
p320
aVwhere a man was going without a salary
p321
aVto get a child her only meal of the day.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry,
p324
aVit wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids,
p325
aVit wasn't rage toward the one percent
p326
aVor pity toward the 99.
p327
aVNo, I was disturbed because I had finally realized
p328
aVthat I was the dialysis
p329
aVfor a country that needed a kidney transplant.
p330
aVI realized that my story stood in for all those
p331
aVwho were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps,
p332
aVeven if they didn't have any boots;
p333
aVthat my organization stood in
p334
aVfor all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem
p335
aVor Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;
p336
aVthat my voice stood in for all those voices
p337
aVthat seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd the shame of that,
p340
aVthat shame washed over me
p341
aVlike the shame of sitting in front of the television,
p342
aVwatching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium
p343
aVagain
p344
aVand again
p345
aVand again.
p346
aVI had been duped,
p347
aVhoodwinked,
p348
aVbamboozled.
p349
aVBut this time, the false savior was me.
p350
aa(lp351
VYou see, I've come a long way  from that altar
p352
aVon the night I thought the world would end,
p353
aVfrom a world where people spoke in tongues
p354
aVand saw suffering as a necessary act of God
p355
aVand took a text to be infallible truth.
p356
aVYes, I've come so far
p357
aVthat I'm right back where I started.
p358
aa(lp359
VBecause it simply is not true to say
p360
aVthat we live in an age of disbelief \u2014
p361
aVno, we believe today just as much as any time that came before.
p362
aVSome of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown
p363
aVor Tony Robbins.
p364
aVWe may believe in the bible of The New Yorker
p365
aVor the Harvard Business Review.
p366
aVWe may believe most deeply
p367
aVwhen we worship right here at the church of TED,
p368
aVbut we desperately want to believe,
p369
aVwe need to believe.
p370
aVWe speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders
p371
aVthat promise to solve all our problems.
p372
aVWe see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god,
p373
aVwe take the text of technological progress
p374
aVto be infallible truth.
p375
aVAnd we hardly realize the human price we pay
p376
aVwhen we fail to question one brick,
p377
aVbecause we fear it might shake our whole foundation.
p378
aa(lp379
VBut if you are disturbed
p380
aVby the unconscionable things that we have come to accept,
p381
aVthen it must be questioning time.
p382
aVSo I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation
p383
aVor a triple bottom line.
p384
aVI do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact.
p385
aVI have and I offer a gospel of doubt.
p386
aVThe gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing,
p387
aVit asks that you believe a new thing:
p388
aVthat it is possible not to believe.
p389
aVIt is possible the answers we have are wrong,
p390
aVit is possible the questions themselves are wrong.
p391
aVYes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we,
p392
aVon this stage, in this room,
p393
aVare wrong.
p394
aVBecause it raises the question, "Why?"
p395
aVWith all the power that we hold in our hands,
p396
aVwhy are people still suffering so bad?
p397
aa(lp398
VThis doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization,
p399
aVMBAs Across America,
p400
aVout of business.
p401
aVWe have shed our staff and closed our doors
p402
aVand we will share our model freely
p403
aVwith anyone who sees their power to do this work
p404
aVwithout waiting for our permission.
p405
aVThis doubt compels me
p406
aVto renounce the role of savior
p407
aVthat some have placed on me,
p408
aVbecause our time is too short and our odds are too long
p409
aVto wait for second comings,
p410
aVwhen the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd this doubt, it fuels me,
p413
aVit gives me hope
p414
aVthat when our troubles overwhelm us,
p415
aVwhen the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise,
p416
aVwhen our healers bring no comfort to our wounds,
p417
aVit will not be our blind faith \u2014
p418
aVno, it will be our humble doubt
p419
aVthat shines a little light into the darkness of our lives
p420
aVand of our world
p421
aVand lets us raise our voice to whisper
p422
aVor to shout
p423
aVor to say simply,
p424
aVvery simply,
p425
aV"There must be another way."
p426
aa(lp427
VThank you.
p428
aa(lp429
