VSo, there's an actor called Dustin Hoffman.
p5
aVAnd years ago, he made this movie which some of you may have heard of,
p6
aVcalled "The Graduate."
p7
aVAnd there's two key scenes in that movie.
p8
aVThe first one is the seduction scene.
p9
aVI'm not going to talk about that tonight.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VThe second scene is where he's taken out by the old guy to the pool,
p14
aVand as a young college graduate, the old guy basically says one word,
p15
aVjust one word.
p16
aVAnd of course, all of you know what that word is.
p17
aVIt's "plastics."
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd the only problem with that is, it was completely the wrong advice.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VLet me tell you why it was so wrong.
p26
aVThe word should have been "silicon."
p27
aVAnd the reason it should have been silicon
p28
aVis because the basic patents for semiconductors had already been made,
p29
aVhad already been filed,
p30
aVand they were already building them.
p31
aVSo Silicon Valley was just being built in 1967,
p32
aVwhen this movie was released.
p33
aVAnd the year after the movie was released,
p34
aVIntel was founded.
p35
aVSo had the graduate heard the right one word,
p36
aVmaybe he would have ended up onstage \u2014 oh, I don't know \u2014
p37
aVmaybe with these two.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo as you're thinking of that,
p42
aVlet's see what bit of advice we might want to give
p43
aVso that your next graduate doesn't become a Tupperware salesman.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VSo in 2015, what word of advice would you give people,
p48
aVwhen you took a college graduate out by the pool
p49
aVand you said one word, just one word?
p50
aVI think the answer would be "lifecode."
p51
aVSo what is "lifecode?"
p52
aVLifecode is the various ways we have of programming life.
p53
aVSo instead of programming computers,
p54
aVwe're using things to program viruses
p55
aVor retroviruses or proteins
p56
aVor DNA or RNA
p57
aVor plants or animals, or a whole series of creatures.
p58
aVAnd as you're thinking about this incredible ability
p59
aVto make life do what you want it to do,
p60
aVwhat it's programmed to do,
p61
aVwhat you end up doing
p62
aVis taking what we've been doing for thousands of years,
p63
aVwhich is breeding, changing,
p64
aVmixing, matching
p65
aVall kinds of life-forms,
p66
aVand we accelerate it.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd this is not something new.
p69
aVThis humble mustard weed has been modified
p70
aVso that if you change it in one way, you get broccoli.
p71
aVAnd if you change it in a second way, you get kale.
p72
aVAnd if you change it in a third way,
p73
aVyou get cauliflower.
p74
aVSo when you go to these all-natural, organic markets,
p75
aVyou're really going to a place
p76
aVwhere people have been changing the lifecode of plants for a long time.
p77
aVThe difference today,
p78
aVto pick a completely politically neutral term \u2014
p79
aa(lp80
V[Intelligent design]
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VWe're beginning to practice intelligent design.
p85
aVThat means that instead of doing this at random
p86
aVand seeing what happens over generations,
p87
aVwe're inserting specific genes, we're inserting specific proteins,
p88
aVand we're changing lifecode for very deliberate purposes.
p89
aVAnd that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens.
p90
aa(lp91
VLet me just give you one example.
p92
aVSome of you occasionally might think about sex.
p93
aVAnd we kind of take it for granted how we've changed sex.
p94
aVSo we think it's perfectly normal and natural to change it.
p95
aVWhat's happened with sex over time is \u2014
p96
aVnormally, sex equals baby, eventually.
p97
aVBut in today's world,
p98
aVsex plus pill equals no baby.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd again, we think that's perfectly normal and natural,
p103
aVbut that has not been the case for most of human history.
p104
aVAnd it's not the case for animals.
p105
aVWhat it is does is it gives us control,
p106
aVso sex becomes separate from conception.
p107
aVAnd as you're thinking of the consequences of that,
p108
aVthen we've been playing with stuff
p109
aVthat's a little bit more advanced, like art.
p110
aVNot in the sense of painting and sculpture,
p111
aVbut in the sense of assisted reproductive technologies.
p112
aVSo what are assisted reproductive technologies?
p113
aVAssisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization.
p114
aVAnd when you do in vitro fertilization, there's very good reasons to do it.
p115
aVSometimes you just can't conceive otherwise.
p116
aVBut when you do that,
p117
aVwhat you\u2019re doing is separating sex, conception, baby.
p118
aVSo you haven't just taken control of when you have a baby,
p119
aVyou've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized.
p120
aVSo you've separated the baby
p121
aVfrom the body from the act.
p122
aVAnd as you're thinking of other things we've been doing,
p123
aVthink about twins.
p124
aVSo you can freeze sperm, you can freeze eggs,
p125
aVyou can freeze fertilized eggs.
p126
aVAnd what does that mean?
p127
aVWell, that's a good thing if you're a cancer patient.
p128
aVYou're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation,
p129
aVso you save these things.
p130
aVYou don't irradiate them.
p131
aVBut if you can save them and you can freeze them,
p132
aVand you can have a surrogate mother,
p133
aVit means that you've decoupled sex from time.
p134
aVIt means you can have twins born \u2014 oh, in 50 years?
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VIn a hundred years?
p139
aVTwo hundred years?
p140
aVAnd these are three really profound changes
p141
aVthat are not, like, future stuff.
p142
aVThis is stuff we take for granted today.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower.
p145
aVIt turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses,
p146
aVof changing plants, of changing animals,
p147
aVperhaps even of evolving ourselves.
p148
aVIt's something that Steve Gullans and I have been thinking about for a while.
p149
aa(lp150
VLet's have some risks.
p151
aVLike every powerful technology, like electricity, like an automobile,
p152
aVlike computers, this stuff potentially can be misused.
p153
aVAnd that scares a lot of people.
p154
aVAnd as you apply these technologies,
p155
aVyou can even turn human beings into chimeras.
p156
aVRemember the Greek myth where you mix animals?
p157
aVWell, some of these treatments
p158
aVactually end up changing your blood type.
p159
aVOr they'll put male cells in a female body or vice versa,
p160
aVwhich sounds absolutely horrible
p161
aVuntil you realize, the reason you're doing that
p162
aVis you're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments.
p163
aVSo by taking somebody else's bone marrow,
p164
aVyou may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself,
p165
aVbut you're also saving your life.
p166
aVAnd as you're thinking about this stuff,
p167
aVhere's something that happened 20 years ago.
p168
aa(lp169
VThis is Emma Ott.
p170
aVShe's a recent college admittee.
p171
aVShe's studying accounting.
p172
aVShe played two varsity sports. She graduated as a valedictorian.
p173
aVAnd that's not particularly extraordinary,
p174
aVexcept that she's the first human being born to three parents.
p175
aVWhy?
p176
aVBecause she had a deadly mitochondrial disease
p177
aVthat she might have inherited.
p178
aVSo when you swap out a third person's DNA
p179
aVand you put it in there,
p180
aVyou save the lives of people.
p181
aVBut you also are doing germline engineering,
p182
aVwhich means her kids, if she has kids, will be saved
p183
aVand won't go through this.
p184
aVAnd [their] kids will be saved,
p185
aVand their grandchildren will be saved,
p186
aVand this passes on.
p187
aa(lp188
VThat makes people nervous.
p189
aVSo 20 years ago, the various authorities said,
p190
aVwhy don't we study this for a while?
p191
aVThere are risks to doing stuff, and there are risks to not doing stuff,
p192
aVbecause there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology,
p193
aVand then we've been thinking about it for the next 20 years.
p194
aVSo as we think about it,
p195
aVas we take the time to say, "Hey, maybe we should have longer studies,
p196
aVmaybe we should do this, maybe we should do that,"
p197
aVthere are consequences to acting, and there are consequences to not acting.
p198
aVLike curing deadly diseases \u2014
p199
aVwhich, by the way, is completely unnatural.
p200
aVIt is normal and natural for humans to be felled
p201
aVby massive epidemics of polio, of smallpox, of tuberculosis.
p202
aVWhen we put vaccines into people, we are putting unnatural things
p203
aVinto their body
p204
aVbecause we think the benefit outweighs the risk.
p205
aVBecause we've built unnatural plants, unnatural animals,
p206
aVwe can feed about seven billion people.
p207
aVWe can do things like create new life-forms.
p208
aVAnd as you create new life-forms, again, that sounds terribly scary
p209
aVand terribly bothersome,
p210
aVuntil you realize that those life-forms live on your dining room table.
p211
aVThose flowers you've got on your dining room table \u2014
p212
aVthere's not a lot that's natural about them,
p213
aVbecause people have been breeding the flowers to make this color,
p214
aVto be this size, to last for a week.
p215
aVYou don't usually give your loved one wildflowers
p216
aVbecause they don't last a whole lot of time.
p217
aa(lp218
VWhat all this does
p219
aVis it flips Darwin completely on his head.
p220
aVSee, for four billion years,
p221
aVwhat lived and died on this planet depended on two principles:
p222
aVon natural selection and random mutation.
p223
aVAnd so what lived and died, what was structured,
p224
aVhas now been flipped on its head.
p225
aVAnd what we've done
p226
aVis created this completely parallel evolutionary system
p227
aVwhere we are practicing unnatural selection and non-random mutation.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo let me explain these things.
p230
aVThis is natural selection.
p231
aVThis is unnatural selection.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo what happens with this stuff is,
p236
aVwe started breeding wolves thousands of years ago
p237
aVin central Asia to turn them into dogs.
p238
aVAnd then we started turning them into big dogs
p239
aVand into little dogs.
p240
aVBut if you take one of the chihuahuas
p241
aVyou see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue
p242
aVand you let it loose on the African plain,
p243
aVyou can watch natural selection happen.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VFew things on Earth are less natural than a cornfield.
p248
aVYou will never, under any scenario, walk through a virgin forest
p249
aVand see the same plant growing in orderly rows
p250
aVat the same time,
p251
aVnothing else living there.
p252
aVWhen you do a cornfield,
p253
aVyou're selecting what lives and what dies.
p254
aVAnd you're doing that through unnatural selection.
p255
aVIt's the same with a wheat field, it's the same with a rice field.
p256
aVIt's the same with a city, it's the same with a suburb.
p257
aVIn fact, half the surface of Earth
p258
aVhas been unnaturally engineered
p259
aVso that what lives and what dies there is what we want,
p260
aVwhich is the reason why you don't have grizzly bears
p261
aVwalking through downtown Manhattan.
p262
aa(lp263
VHow about this random mutation stuff?
p264
aVWell, this is random mutation.
p265
aVThis is Antonio Alfonseca.
p266
aVHe's otherwise known as the Octopus, his nickname.
p267
aVHe was the Relief Pitcher of the Year in 2000.
p268
aVAnd he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers
p269
aVon each hand,
p270
aVwhich turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VHow about non-random mutation?
p275
aVA non-random mutation is beer.
p276
aVIt's wine. It's yogurt.
p277
aVHow many times have you walked through the forest
p278
aVand found all-natural cheese?
p279
aVOr all-natural yogurt?
p280
aVSo we've been engineering this stuff.
p281
aVNow, the interesting thing is,
p282
aVwe get to know the stuff better.
p283
aVWe found one of the single most powerful gene-editing instruments,
p284
aVCRISPR, inside yogurt.
p285
aVAnd as we start engineering cells,
p286
aVwe're producing eight out of the top 10 pharmaceutical products,
p287
aVincluding the stuff that you use to treat arthritis,
p288
aVwhich is the number one best-selling drug, Humira.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo this lifecode stuff.
p291
aVIt really is a superpower.
p292
aVIt really is a way of programming stuff,
p293
aVand there's nothing that's going to change us
p294
aVmore than this lifecode.
p295
aVSo as you're thinking of lifecode,
p296
aVlet's think of five principles
p297
aVas to how we start guiding,
p298
aVand I'd love you to give me more.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo, principle number one:
p301
aVwe have to take responsibility for this stuff.
p302
aVThe reason we have to take responsibility
p303
aVis because we're in charge.
p304
aVThese aren't random mutations.
p305
aVThis is what we are doing, what we are choosing.
p306
aVIt's not, "Stuff happened."
p307
aVIt didn't happen at random.
p308
aVIt didn't come down by a verdict of somebody else.
p309
aVWe engineer this stuff,
p310
aVand it's the Pottery Barn rule: you break it, you own it.
p311
aa(lp312
VPrinciple number two:
p313
aVwe have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff.
p314
aVThere have been at least 33 versions of hominids
p315
aVthat have walked around this Earth.
p316
aVMost all of them went extinct except us.
p317
aVBut the normal and natural state of this Earth
p318
aVis we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time,
p319
aVwhich is why most of us have some Neanderthal in us.
p320
aVSome of us have some Denisova in us.
p321
aVAnd some in Washington have a lot more of it.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Laughter)
p324
aa(lp325
VPrinciple number three:
p326
aVwe have to respect other people's choices.
p327
aVSome people will choose to never alter.
p328
aVSome people will choose to alter all.
p329
aVSome people will choose to alter plants but not animals.
p330
aVSome people will choose to alter themselves.
p331
aVSome people will choose to evolve themselves.
p332
aVDiversity is not a bad thing,
p333
aVbecause even though we think of humans as very diverse,
p334
aVwe came so close to extinction
p335
aVthat all of us descend from a single African mother
p336
aVand the consequence of that
p337
aVis there's more genetic diversity in 55 African chimpanzees
p338
aVthan there are in seven billion humans.
p339
aa(lp340
VPrinciple number four:
p341
aVwe should take about a quarter of the Earth
p342
aVand only let Darwin run the show there.
p343
aVIt doesn't have to be contiguous,
p344
aVdoesn't have to all be tied together.
p345
aVIt should be part in the oceans, part on land.
p346
aVBut we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet.
p347
aVWe want to have our evolutionary system running.
p348
aVWe want to have Darwin's evolutionary system running.
p349
aVAnd it's just really important to have these two things running in parallel
p350
aVand not overwhelm evolution.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Applause)
p353
aa(lp354
VLast thing I'll say.
p355
aVThis is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on.
p356
aVThis is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had.
p357
aVIt would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff
p358
aVbecause you're scared of it,
p359
aVbecause you're hiding from it.
p360
aVYou can participate in the ethics. You can participate in the politics.
p361
aVYou can participate in the business.
p362
aVYou can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going,
p363
aVwhere industry is going,
p364
aVwhere we're going to take the world.
p365
aVIt would be a crime for all of us
p366
aVnot to be aware when somebody shows up at a swimming pool
p367
aVand says one word, just one word,
p368
aVif you don't listen if that word is "lifecode."
p369
aa(lp370
VThank you very much.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
