VSeven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company.
p5
aVHe said, "I'm working with three friends,
p6
aVand we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online."
p7
aVAnd I said, "OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?"
p8
aV"No, we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out."
p9
aV"All right, but you're going to go in full time once you graduate."
p10
aV"Not exactly. We've all lined up backup jobs."
p11
aVSix months go by,
p12
aVit's the day before the company launches,
p13
aVand there is still not a functioning website.
p14
aV"You guys realize, the entire company is a website.
p15
aVThat's literally all it is."
p16
aVSo I obviously declined to invest.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd they ended up naming the company Warby Parker.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aVThey sell glasses online.
p22
aVThey were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company
p23
aVand valued at over a billion dollars.
p24
aVAnd now? My wife handles our investments.
p25
aVWhy was I so wrong?
p26
aa(lp27
VTo find out, I've been studying people that I come to call "originals."
p28
aVOriginals are nonconformists,
p29
aVpeople who not only have new ideas
p30
aVbut take action to champion them.
p31
aVThey are people who stand out and speak up.
p32
aVOriginals drive creativity and change in the world.
p33
aVThey're the people you want to bet on.
p34
aVAnd they look nothing like I expected.
p35
aVI want to show you today three things I've learned
p36
aVabout recognizing originals
p37
aVand becoming a little bit more like them.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker
p40
aVwas they were really slow getting off the ground.
p41
aVNow, you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator.
p42
aVWell, I have a confession for you. I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.
p43
aVYes, that's an actual term.
p44
aVYou know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline
p45
aVwhen you haven't done anything yet.
p46
aVI just feel that a few months ahead of time.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously.
p51
aVI would wake up at 5am,
p52
aVstart playing and not stop until I had mastered them.
p53
aVEventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came
p54
aVand did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VSince then, I have traded hair for teeth.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut this served me well in college,
p65
aVbecause I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline.
p66
aVAnd I was proud of that, until a few years ago.
p67
aVI had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said,
p68
aV"I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating."
p69
aVAnd I was like, "That's cute, where are the four papers you owe me?"
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VNo, she was one of our most creative students,
p74
aVand as an organizational psychologist, this is the kind of idea that I test.
p75
aVSo I challenged her to get some data.
p76
aVShe goes into a bunch of companies.
p77
aVShe has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate.
p78
aVThen she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are.
p79
aVAnd sure enough, the precrastinators like me,
p80
aVwho rush in and do everything early
p81
aVare rated as less creative
p82
aVthan people who procrastinate moderately.
p83
aVSo I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators.
p84
aVShe was like, "I don't know. They didn't fill out my survey."
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VNo, here are our results.
p89
aVYou actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute
p90
aVare so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas.
p91
aVAnd on the flip side, the people who race in
p92
aVare in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either.
p93
aVThere's a sweet spot where originals seem to live.
p94
aVWhy is this?
p95
aVMaybe original people just have bad work habits.
p96
aVMaybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.
p97
aa(lp98
VTo find out, we designed some experiments.
p99
aVWe asked people to generate new business ideas,
p100
aVand then we get independent readers
p101
aVto evaluate how creative and useful they are.
p102
aVAnd some of them are asked to do the task right away.
p103
aVOthers we randomly assign to procrastinate
p104
aVby dangling Minesweeper in front of them
p105
aVfor either five or 10 minutes.
p106
aVAnd sure enough, the moderate procrastinators
p107
aVare 16 percent more creative than the other two groups.
p108
aVNow, Minesweeper is awesome, but it's not the driver of the effect,
p109
aVbecause if you play the game first before you learn about the task,
p110
aVthere's no creativity boost.
p111
aVIt's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem,
p112
aVand then you start procrastinating,
p113
aVbut the task is still active in the back of your mind,
p114
aVthat you start to incubate.
p115
aVProcrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas,
p116
aVto think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo just as we were finishing these experiments,
p119
aVI was starting to write a book about originals,
p120
aVand I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate,
p121
aVwhile writing a chapter on procrastination."
p122
aVSo I metaprocrastinated,
p123
aVand like any self-respecting precrastinator,
p124
aVI woke up early the next morning
p125
aVand I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd then I worked diligently
p130
aVtoward my goal of not making progress toward my goal.
p131
aVI started writing the procrastination chapter,
p132
aVand one day \u2014 I was halfway through \u2014
p133
aVI literally put it away in mid-sentence
p134
aVfor months.
p135
aVIt was agony.
p136
aVBut when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas.
p137
aVAs Aaron Sorkin put it,
p138
aV"You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking."
p139
aVAnd along the way I discovered
p140
aVthat a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators.
p141
aVTake Leonardo da Vinci.
p142
aVHe toiled on and off for 16 years
p143
aVon the Mona Lisa.
p144
aVHe felt like a failure.
p145
aVHe wrote as much in his journal.
p146
aVBut some of the diversions he took in optics
p147
aVtransformed the way that he modeled light
p148
aVand made him into a much better painter.
p149
aVWhat about Martin Luther King, Jr.?
p150
aVThe night before the biggest speech of his life,
p151
aVthe March on Washington,
p152
aVhe was up past 3am, rewriting it.
p153
aVHe's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage,
p154
aVand he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines.
p155
aVWhen he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,
p156
aVhe leaves his prepared remarks
p157
aVto utter four words that changed the course of history:
p158
aV"I have a dream."
p159
aVThat was not in the script.
p160
aVBy delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute,
p161
aVhe left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas.
p162
aVAnd because the text wasn't set in stone,
p163
aVhe had freedom to improvise.
p164
aa(lp165
VProcrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity,
p166
aVbut it can be a virtue for creativity.
p167
aVWhat you see with a lot of great originals
p168
aVis that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish.
p169
aVAnd this is what I missed with Warby Parker.
p170
aVWhen they were dragging their heels for six months,
p171
aVI looked at them and said,
p172
aV"You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online."
p173
aVThey missed the first-mover advantage.
p174
aVBut what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time
p175
aVtrying to figure out how to get people
p176
aVto be comfortable ordering glasses online.
p177
aVAnd it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth.
p178
aVLook at a classic study of over 50 product categories,
p179
aVcomparing the first movers who created the market
p180
aVwith the improvers who introduced something different and better.
p181
aVWhat you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent,
p182
aVcompared with only 8 percent for the improvers.
p183
aVLook at Facebook, waiting to build a social network
p184
aVuntil after Myspace and Friendster.
p185
aVLook at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo.
p186
aVIt's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea
p187
aVthan it is to create something new from scratch.
p188
aVSo the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first.
p189
aVYou just have to be different and better.
p190
aa(lp191
VBut that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker.
p192
aVThey were also full of doubts.
p193
aVThey had backup plans lined up,
p194
aVand that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original,
p195
aVbecause I expected that originals would look something like this.
p196
aa(lp197
V(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, on the surface,
p200
aVa lot of original people look confident,
p201
aVbut behind the scenes,
p202
aVthey feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do.
p203
aVThey just manage it differently.
p204
aVLet me show you: this is a depiction
p205
aVof how the creative process works for most of us.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VNow, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt.
p210
aVThere's self-doubt and idea doubt.
p211
aVSelf-doubt is paralyzing.
p212
aVIt leads you to freeze.
p213
aVBut idea doubt is energizing.
p214
aVIt motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine,
p215
aVjust like MLK did.
p216
aVAnd so the key to being original
p217
aVis just a simple thing
p218
aVof avoiding the leap from step three to step four.
p219
aVInstead of saying, "I'm crap,"
p220
aVyou say, "The first few drafts are always crap,
p221
aVand I'm just not there yet."
p222
aVSo how do you get there?
p223
aVWell, there's a clue, it turns out,
p224
aVin the Internet browser that you use.
p225
aVWe can predict your job performance and your commitment
p226
aVjust by knowing what web browser you use.
p227
aVNow, some of you are not going to like the results of this study \u2014
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VBut there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users
p232
aVsignificantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users.
p233
aVYes.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Applause)
p236
aa(lp237
VThey also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way.
p238
aVWhy? It's not a technical advantage.
p239
aVThe four browser groups on average have similar typing speed
p240
aVand they also have similar levels of computer knowledge.
p241
aVIt's about how you got the browser.
p242
aVBecause if you use Internet Explorer or Safari,
p243
aVthose came preinstalled on your computer,
p244
aVand you accepted the default option that was handed to you.
p245
aVIf you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default
p246
aVand ask, is there a different option out there,
p247
aVand then be a little resourceful and download a new browser.
p248
aVSo people hear about this study and they're like,
p249
aV"Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?"
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VNo, it's about being the kind of person
p254
aVwho takes the initiative to doubt the default
p255
aVand look for a better option.
p256
aVAnd if you do that well,
p257
aVyou will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu.
p258
aVThere's a name for it. It's called vuja de.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VVuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before
p263
aVand all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes.
p264
aVIt's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script
p265
aVthat can't get the green light for more than half a century.
p266
aVIn every past version, the main character has been an evil queen.
p267
aVBut Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense.
p268
aVShe rewrites the first act,
p269
aVreinvents the villain as a tortured hero
p270
aVand Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever.
p271
aVSo there's a simple message from this story.
p272
aVWhen you feel doubt, don't let it go.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VWhat about fear?
p277
aVOriginals feel fear, too.
p278
aVThey're afraid of failing,
p279
aVbut what sets them apart from the rest of us
p280
aVis that they're even more afraid of failing to try.
p281
aVThey know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt
p282
aVor by failing to start a business at all.
p283
aVThey know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions
p284
aVbut our inactions.
p285
aVThe things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science,
p286
aVare the chances not taken.
p287
aa(lp288
VElon Musk told me recently, he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.
p289
aVHe was sure the first few SpaceX launches
p290
aVwould fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back,
p291
aVbut it was too important not to try.
p292
aVAnd for so many of us, when we have an important idea,
p293
aVwe don't bother to try.
p294
aVBut I have some good news for you.
p295
aVYou are not going to get judged on your bad ideas.
p296
aVA lot of people think they will.
p297
aVIf you look across industries
p298
aVand ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion,
p299
aV85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up.
p300
aVThey were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid.
p301
aVBut guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas,
p302
aVtons of them, in fact.
p303
aVTake the guy who invented this.
p304
aVDo you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy
p305
aVthat it scared not only kids but adults, too?
p306
aVNo. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VIf you look across fields,
p311
aVthe greatest originals are the ones who fail the most,
p312
aVbecause they're the ones who try the most.
p313
aVTake classical composers, the best of the best.
p314
aVWhy do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others
p315
aVand also have their compositions rerecorded more times?
p316
aVOne of the best predictors
p317
aVis the sheer volume of compositions that they generate.
p318
aVThe more output you churn out, the more variety you get
p319
aVand the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original.
p320
aVEven the three icons of classical music \u2014 Bach, Beethoven, Mozart \u2014
p321
aVhad to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions
p322
aVto come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces.
p323
aVNow, you may be wondering,
p324
aVhow did this guy become great without doing a whole lot?
p325
aVI don't know how Wagner pulled that off.
p326
aVBut for most of us, if we want to be more original,
p327
aVwe have to generate more ideas.
p328
aa(lp329
VThe Warby Parker founders, when they were trying to name their company,
p330
aVthey needed something sophisticated, unique, with no negative associations
p331
aVto build a retail brand,
p332
aVand they tested over 2,000 possibilities
p333
aVbefore they finally put together
p334
aVWarby and Parker.
p335
aVSo if you put all this together, what you see is that originals
p336
aVare not that different from the rest of us.
p337
aVThey feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate.
p338
aVThey have bad ideas.
p339
aVAnd sometimes, it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them
p340
aVthat they succeed.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did.
p343
aVDon't write them off.
p344
aVAnd when that's you, don't count yourself out either.
p345
aVKnow that being quick to start but slow to finish
p346
aVcan boost your creativity,
p347
aVthat you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas
p348
aVand embracing the fear of failing to try,
p349
aVand that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.
p350
aa(lp351
VLook, being original is not easy,
p352
aVbut I have no doubt about this:
p353
aVit's the best way to improve the world around us.
p354
aa(lp355
VThank you.
p356
aa(lp357
