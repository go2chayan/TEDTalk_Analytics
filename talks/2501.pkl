VHi.
p5
aVLet me ask the audience a question:
p6
aVDid you ever lie as a child?
p7
aVIf you did, could you please raise your hand?
p8
aVWow! This is the most honest group of people I've ever met.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo for the last 20 years,
p13
aVI've been studying how children learn to tell lies.
p14
aVAnd today, I'm going to share with you
p15
aVsome of the discoveries we have made.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina,
p18
aVwho is my friend and an elementary school principal.
p19
aVHe got a phone call one day.
p20
aVThe caller says,
p21
aV"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny will not come to school today
p22
aVbecause he's sick."
p23
aa(lp24
VMr. Messina asks,
p25
aV"Who am I speaking to, please?"
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd the caller says,
p28
aV"I am my father."
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VSo this story \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
Vsums up very nicely three common beliefs we have
p37
aVabout children and lying.
p38
aVOne, children only come to tell lies
p39
aVafter entering elementary school.
p40
aVTwo, children are poor liars.
p41
aVWe adults can easily detect their lies.
p42
aVAnd three, if children lie at a very young age,
p43
aVthere must be some character flaws with them,
p44
aVand they are going to become pathological liars for life.
p45
aVWell, it turns out
p46
aVall of the three beliefs are wrong.
p47
aa(lp48
VWe have been playing guessing games
p49
aVwith children all over the world.
p50
aVHere is an example.
p51
aVSo in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards.
p52
aVAnd we tell them if they win the game,
p53
aVthey are going to get a big prize.
p54
aVBut in the middle of the game,
p55
aVwe make an excuse and leave the room.
p56
aVAnd before we leave the room,
p57
aVwe tell them not to peek at the cards.
p58
aVOf course,
p59
aVwe have hidden cameras in the room
p60
aVto watch their every move.
p61
aVBecause the desire to win the game is so strong,
p62
aVmore than 90 percent of children will peek
p63
aVas soon as we leave the room.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VThe crucial question is:
p68
aVWhen we return and ask the children
p69
aVwhether or not they have peeked,
p70
aVwill the children who peeked confess
p71
aVor lie about their transgression?
p72
aa(lp73
VWe found that regardless of gender, country, religion,
p74
aVat two years of age,
p75
aV30 percent lie,
p76
aV70 percent tell the truth about their transgression.
p77
aVAt three years of age,
p78
aV50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth.
p79
aVAt four years of age,
p80
aVmore than 80 percent lie.
p81
aVAnd after four years of age,
p82
aVmost children lie.
p83
aVSo as you can see,
p84
aVlying is really a typical part of development.
p85
aVAnd some children begin to tell lies
p86
aVas young as two years of age.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo now, let's take a closer look at the younger children.
p89
aVWhy do some but not all young children lie?
p90
aVIn cooking, you need good ingredients
p91
aVto cook good food.
p92
aVAnd good lying requires two key ingredients.
p93
aVThe first key ingredient is theory of mind,
p94
aVor the mind-reading ability.
p95
aVMind reading is the ability to know
p96
aVthat different people have different knowledge about the situation
p97
aVand the ability to differentiate between what I know
p98
aVand what you know.
p99
aVMind reading is important for lying
p100
aVbecause the basis of lying is that I know
p101
aVyou don't know
p102
aVwhat I know.
p103
aVTherefore, I can lie to you.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe second key ingredient for good lying is self-control.
p106
aVIt is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression
p107
aVand your body language,
p108
aVso that you can tell a convincing lie.
p109
aVAnd we found that those young children
p110
aVwho have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities
p111
aVtell lies earlier
p112
aVand are more sophisticated liars.
p113
aVAs it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us
p114
aVto function well in our society.
p115
aVIn fact, deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities
p116
aVare associated with serious developmental problems,
p117
aVsuch as ADHD and autism.
p118
aVSo if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie,
p119
aVinstead of being alarmed,
p120
aVyou should celebrate \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
Vbecause it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone
p125
aVof typical development.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, are children poor liars?
p128
aVDo you think you can easily detect their lies?
p129
aVWould you like to give it a try?
p130
aVYes? OK.
p131
aVSo I'm going to show you two videos.
p132
aVIn the videos,
p133
aVthe children are going to respond to a researcher's question,
p134
aV"Did you peek?"
p135
aVSo try to tell me
p136
aVwhich child is lying
p137
aVand which child is telling the truth.
p138
aVHere's child number one.
p139
aVAre you ready?
p140
aa(lp141
V(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
p142
aa(lp143
VKang Lee: And this is child number two.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
p146
aa(lp147
VKL: OK, if you think child number one is lying,
p148
aVplease raise your hand.
p149
aVAnd if you think child number two is lying, please raise your hand.
p150
aVOK, so as a matter of fact,
p151
aVchild number one is telling the truth,
p152
aVchild number two is lying.
p153
aVLooks like many of you are terrible detectors of children's lies.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, we have played similar kinds of games
p158
aVwith many, many adults from all walks of life.
p159
aVAnd we show them many videos.
p160
aVIn half of the videos, the children lied.
p161
aVIn the other half of the videos, the children told the truth.
p162
aVAnd let's find out how these adults performed.
p163
aVBecause there are as many liars as truth tellers,
p164
aVif you guess randomly,
p165
aVthere's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right.
p166
aVSo if your accuracy is around 50 percent,
p167
aVit means you are a terrible detector of children's lies.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo let's start with undergrads and law school students,
p170
aVwho typically have limited experience with children.
p171
aVNo, they cannot detect children's lies.
p172
aVTheir performance is around chance.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow how about social workers and child-protection lawyers,
p175
aVwho work with children on a daily basis?
p176
aVCan they detect children's lies?
p177
aVNo, they cannot.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VWhat about judges,
p182
aVcustoms officers
p183
aVand police officers,
p184
aVwho deal with liars on a daily basis?
p185
aVCan they detect children's lies?
p186
aVNo, they cannot.
p187
aa(lp188
VWhat about parents?
p189
aVCan parents detect other children's lies?
p190
aVNo, they cannot.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhat about, can parents detect their own children's lies?
p193
aVNo, they cannot.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p196
aa(lp197
VSo now you may ask
p198
aVwhy children's lies are so difficult to detect.
p199
aVLet me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan.
p200
aVThis is his facial expression
p201
aVwhen he lies.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo when children lie,
p206
aVtheir facial expression is typically neutral.
p207
aVHowever, behind this neutral expression,
p208
aVthe child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions,
p209
aVsuch as fear, guilt, shame
p210
aVand maybe a little bit of liar's delight.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VUnfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden.
p215
aVTherefore, it's mostly invisible to us.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo in the last five years,
p218
aVwe have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions.
p219
aVThen we made a discovery.
p220
aa(lp221
VWe know that underneath our facial skin,
p222
aVthere's a rich network of blood vessels.
p223
aVWhen we experience different emotions,
p224
aVour facial blood flow changes subtly.
p225
aVAnd these changes are regulated by the autonomic system
p226
aVthat is beyond our conscious control.
p227
aVBy looking at facial blood flow changes,
p228
aVwe can reveal people's hidden emotions.
p229
aVUnfortunately, such emotion-related facial blood flow changes
p230
aVare too subtle to detect by our naked eye.
p231
aVSo to help us reveal people's facial emotions,
p232
aVwe have developed a new imaging technology
p233
aVwe call "transdermal optical imaging."
p234
aa(lp235
VTo do so, we use a regular video camera to record people
p236
aVwhen they experience various hidden emotions.
p237
aVAnd then, using our image processing technology,
p238
aVwe can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes.
p239
aVBy looking at transdermal video images,
p240
aVnow we can easily see
p241
aVfacial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions.
p242
aVAnd using this technology,
p243
aVwe can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying,
p244
aVand therefore detect people's lies.
p245
aVWe can do so noninvasively,
p246
aVremotely, inexpensively,
p247
aVwith an accuracy at about 85 percent,
p248
aVwhich is far better than chance level.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd in addition, we discovered a Pinocchio effect.
p251
aVNo, not this Pinocchio effect.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VThis is the real Pinocchio effect.
p256
aVWhen people lie,
p257
aVthe facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases,
p258
aVand the facial blood flow on the nose increases.
p259
aa(lp260
VOf course, lying is not the only situation
p261
aVthat will evoke our hidden emotions.
p262
aVSo then we asked ourselves,
p263
aVin addition to detecting lies,
p264
aVhow can our technology be used?
p265
aVOne application is in education.
p266
aVFor example, using this technology, we can help this mathematics teacher
p267
aVto identify the student in his classroom
p268
aVwho may experience high anxiety about the topic he's teaching
p269
aVso that he can help him.
p270
aVAnd also we can use this in health care.
p271
aVFor example, every day I Skype my parents,
p272
aVwho live thousands of miles away.
p273
aVAnd using this technology,
p274
aVI can not only find out what's going on in their lives
p275
aVbut also simultaneously monitor their heart rate, their stress level,
p276
aVtheir mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain.
p277
aVAnd perhaps in the future,
p278
aVtheir risks for heart attack or hypertension.
p279
aVAnd you may ask:
p280
aVCan we use this also to reveal politicians' emotions?
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VFor example, during a debate.
p285
aVWell, the answer is yes.
p286
aVUsing TV footage,
p287
aVwe could detect the politicians' heart rate,
p288
aVmood and stress,
p289
aVand perhaps in the future, whether or not they are lying to us.
p290
aVWe can also use this in marketing research,
p291
aVfor example, to find out
p292
aVwhether or not people like certain consumer products.
p293
aVWe can even use it in dating.
p294
aVSo for example,
p295
aVif your date is smiling at you,
p296
aVthis technology can help you to determine
p297
aVwhether she actually likes you
p298
aVor she is just trying to be nice to you.
p299
aVAnd in this case,
p300
aVshe is just trying to be nice to you.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VSo transdermal optical imaging technology
p305
aVis at a very early stage of development.
p306
aVMany new applications will come about that we don't know today.
p307
aVHowever, one thing I know for sure
p308
aVis that lying will never be the same again.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you very much.
p311
aa(lp312
VXiè xie.
