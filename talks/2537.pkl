VSo I'd like you to imagine for a moment
p5
aVthat you're a soldier in the heat of battle.
p6
aVMaybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer
p7
aVor maybe you're a Zulu warrior.
p8
aVRegardless of your time and place, there are some things that are constant.
p9
aVYour adrenaline is elevated,
p10
aVand your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes,
p11
aVreflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side
p12
aVand to defeat the enemy.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role,
p15
aVthat of the scout.
p16
aVThe scout's job is not to attack or defend.
p17
aVThe scout's job is to understand.
p18
aVThe scout is the one going out,
p19
aVmapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles.
p20
aVAnd the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge
p21
aVin a convenient location across a river.
p22
aVBut above all, the scout wants to know what's really there,
p23
aVas accurately as possible.
p24
aVAnd in a real, actual army, both the soldier and the scout are essential.
p25
aVBut you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset \u2014
p26
aVa metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas
p27
aVin our daily lives.
p28
aVWhat I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment,
p29
aVmaking accurate predictions, making good decisions,
p30
aVis mostly about which mindset you're in.
p31
aa(lp32
VTo illustrate these mindsets in action,
p33
aVI'm going to take you back to 19th-century France,
p34
aVwhere this innocuous-looking piece of paper
p35
aVlaunched one of the biggest political scandals in history.
p36
aVIt was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff.
p37
aVIt was torn up in a wastepaper basket,
p38
aVbut when they pieced it back together,
p39
aVthey discovered that someone in their ranks
p40
aVhad been selling military secrets to Germany.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo they launched a big investigation,
p43
aVand their suspicions quickly converged on this man,
p44
aVAlfred Dreyfus.
p45
aVHe had a sterling record,
p46
aVno past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell.
p47
aVBut Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army,
p48
aVand unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.
p49
aVThey compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo
p50
aVand concluded that it was a match,
p51
aVeven though outside professional handwriting experts
p52
aVwere much less confident in the similarity,
p53
aVbut never mind that.
p54
aVThey went and searched Dreyfus's apartment,
p55
aVlooking for any signs of espionage.
p56
aVThey went through his files, and they didn't find anything.
p57
aVThis just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty,
p58
aVbut sneaky as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence
p59
aVbefore they had managed to get to it.
p60
aa(lp61
VNext, they went and looked through his personal history
p62
aVfor any incriminating details.
p63
aVThey talked to his teachers,
p64
aVthey found that he had studied foreign languages in school,
p65
aVwhich clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments
p66
aVlater in life.
p67
aVHis teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory,
p68
aVwhich was highly suspicious, right?
p69
aVYou know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo the case went to trial, and Dreyfus was found guilty.
p72
aVAfterwards, they took him out into this public square
p73
aVand ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform
p74
aVand broke his sword in two.
p75
aVThis was called the Degradation of Dreyfus.
p76
aVAnd they sentenced him to life imprisonment
p77
aVon the aptly named Devil's Island,
p78
aVwhich is this barren rock off the coast of South America.
p79
aVSo there he went, and there he spent his days alone,
p80
aVwriting letters and letters to the French government
p81
aVbegging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence.
p82
aVBut for the most part, France considered the matter closed.
p83
aa(lp84
VOne thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair
p85
aVis this question of why the officers were so convinced
p86
aVthat Dreyfus was guilty.
p87
aVI mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up,
p88
aVthat they were intentionally framing him.
p89
aVBut historians don't think that's what happened.
p90
aVAs far as we can tell,
p91
aVthe officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong.
p92
aVWhich makes you wonder:
p93
aVWhat does it say about the human mind
p94
aVthat we can find such paltry evidence
p95
aVto be compelling enough to convict a man?
p96
aa(lp97
VWell, this is a case of what scientists call "motivated reasoning."
p98
aVIt's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations,
p99
aVour desires and fears,
p100
aVshape the way we interpret information.
p101
aVSome information, some ideas, feel like our allies.
p102
aVWe want them to win. We want to defend them.
p103
aVAnd other information or ideas are the enemy,
p104
aVand we want to shoot them down.
p105
aVSo this is why I call motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."
p106
aa(lp107
VProbably most of you have never persecuted
p108
aVa French-Jewish officer for high treason,
p109
aVI assume,
p110
aVbut maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed
p111
aVthat when the referee judges that your team committed a foul,
p112
aVfor example,
p113
aVyou're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong.
p114
aVBut if he judges that the other team committed a foul \u2014 awesome!
p115
aVThat's a good call, let's not examine it too closely.
p116
aVOr, maybe you've read an article or a study
p117
aVthat examined some controversial policy,
p118
aVlike capital punishment.
p119
aVAnd, as researchers have demonstrated,
p120
aVif you support capital punishment
p121
aVand the study shows that it's not effective,
p122
aVthen you're highly motivated to find all the reasons
p123
aVwhy the study was poorly designed.
p124
aVBut if it shows that capital punishment works,
p125
aVit's a good study.
p126
aVAnd vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment, same thing.
p127
aa(lp128
VOur judgment is strongly influenced, unconsciously,
p129
aVby which side we want to win.
p130
aVAnd this is ubiquitous.
p131
aVThis shapes how we think about our health, our relationships,
p132
aVhow we decide how to vote,
p133
aVwhat we consider fair or ethical.
p134
aVWhat's most scary to me about motivated reasoning
p135
aVor soldier mindset,
p136
aVis how unconscious it is.
p137
aVWe can think we're being objective and fair-minded
p138
aVand still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man.
p139
aa(lp140
VHowever, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story is not over.
p141
aVThis is Colonel Picquart.
p142
aVHe's another high-ranking officer in the French Army,
p143
aVand like most people, he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.
p144
aVAlso like most people in the army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic.
p145
aVBut at a certain point, Picquart began to suspect:
p146
aV"What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"
p147
aVWhat happened was, he had discovered evidence
p148
aVthat the spying for Germany had continued,
p149
aVeven after Dreyfus was in prison.
p150
aVAnd he had also discovered that another officer in the army
p151
aVhad handwriting that perfectly matched the memo,
p152
aVmuch closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.
p153
aVSo he brought these discoveries to his superiors,
p154
aVbut to his dismay, they either didn't care
p155
aVor came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings,
p156
aVlike, "Well, all you've really shown, Picquart, is that there's another spy
p157
aVwho learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting,
p158
aVand he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left.
p159
aVBut Dreyfus is still guilty."
p160
aVEventually, Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated.
p161
aVBut it took him 10 years,
p162
aVand for part of that time, he himself was in prison
p163
aVfor the crime of disloyalty to the army.
p164
aa(lp165
VA lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story
p166
aVbecause he was an anti-Semite and that's bad, which I agree with.
p167
aVBut personally, for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic
p168
aVactually makes his actions more admirable,
p169
aVbecause he had the same prejudices, the same reasons to be biased
p170
aVas his fellow officers,
p171
aVbut his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo to me,
p174
aVPicquart is a poster child for what I call "scout mindset."
p175
aVIt's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose,
p176
aVbut just to see what's really there
p177
aVas honestly and accurately as you can,
p178
aVeven if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant.
p179
aVThis mindset is what I'm personally passionate about.
p180
aVAnd I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out
p181
aVwhat causes scout mindset.
p182
aVWhy are some people, sometimes at least,
p183
aVable to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations
p184
aVand just try to see the facts and the evidence
p185
aVas objectively as they can?
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd the answer is emotional.
p188
aVSo, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions
p189
aVlike defensiveness or tribalism,
p190
aVscout mindset is, too.
p191
aVIt's just rooted in different emotions.
p192
aVFor example, scouts are curious.
p193
aVThey're more likely to say they feel pleasure
p194
aVwhen they learn new information
p195
aVor an itch to solve a puzzle.
p196
aVThey're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something
p197
aVthat contradicts their expectations.
p198
aVScouts also have different values.
p199
aVThey're more likely to say they think it's virtuous
p200
aVto test your own beliefs,
p201
aVand they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind
p202
aVseems weak.
p203
aVAnd above all, scouts are grounded,
p204
aVwhich means their self-worth as a person
p205
aVisn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic.
p206
aVSo they can believe that capital punishment works.
p207
aVIf studies come out showing that it doesn't, they can say,
p208
aV"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."
p209
aa(lp210
VThis cluster of traits is what researchers have found \u2014
p211
aVand I've also found anecdotally \u2014
p212
aVpredicts good judgment.
p213
aVAnd the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits
p214
aVis that they're primarily not about how smart you are
p215
aVor about how much you know.
p216
aVIn fact, they don't correlate very much with IQ at all.
p217
aVThey're about how you feel.
p218
aVThere's a quote that I keep coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
p219
aVHe's the author of "The Little Prince."
p220
aVHe said, "If you want to build a ship,
p221
aVdon't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders
p222
aVand distribute the work.
p223
aVInstead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."
p224
aa(lp225
VIn other words, I claim,
p226
aVif we really want to improve our judgment as individuals
p227
aVand as societies,
p228
aVwhat we need most is not more instruction in logic
p229
aVor rhetoric or probability or economics,
p230
aVeven though those things are quite valuable.
p231
aVBut what we most need to use those principles well
p232
aVis scout mindset.
p233
aVWe need to change the way we feel.
p234
aVWe need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed
p235
aVwhen we notice we might have been wrong about something.
p236
aVWe need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive
p237
aVwhen we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo the question I want to leave you with is:
p240
aVWhat do you most yearn for?
p241
aVDo you yearn to defend your own beliefs?
p242
aVOr do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Applause)

To prevent that from happening, I try thinking of my belief as no longer being my belief, just a belief that I\'m examining alongside other alternatives. (In fact, I find it useful to visualize this figuratively, imagining the belief under discussion as being located somewhere a few feet away from my body. Weird, but you\'d be surprised how much it can help lessen your sense of identification with the idea.)\'"}], "title": ""}], "published": true, "type": "recommendation", "blurb": "Check out reading resources curated by Julia Galef."}, "corrections": []}], "event": "TEDxPSU", "name": "Julia Galef: Why you think you\'re right -- even if you\'re wrong"}'
