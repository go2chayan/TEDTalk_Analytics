V[SHIT]
p5
aa(lp6
VThis is arguably the back end of the design of animals.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut the reason I put this up here is because
p11
aVwhen I was in Africa last year, my wife and I were driving around,
p12
aVwe had this wonderful guide,
p13
aVwho showed us something that surprised both of us,
p14
aVand it was very revealing in terms of the fascination
p15
aVthat comes with the design of animals.
p16
aVIt turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa
p17
aVto spread the word of Christianity,
p18
aVto teach English to the natives.
p19
aVAnd they brought blackboards and chalk.
p20
aVAnd I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard,
p21
aVand I just used some chalk on there.
p22
aVAnd they brought quite a bit of this stuff.
p23
aVBut over the years, the blackboards were fine,
p24
aVbut they ran out of chalk.
p25
aVAnd this is a real crisis for them.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd that's where the hyena comes in.
p28
aVThe hyena is probably the most perfectly designed
p29
aVscavenging animal in the world.
p30
aVIt strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth,
p31
aVbecause it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones.
p32
aVNow, the end product of that action is up on the board here.
p33
aVWhat the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around
p34
aVand they'd pick up hyena shit.
p35
aVAnd the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VThat's not what I'm here to talk about,
p40
aVbut it is a fascinating aspect of animal design.
p41
aVWhat I'm here to talk about is the camel.
p42
aVWhen I started talking to Richard
p43
aVabout what I was going to speak about,
p44
aVI had recently come back from Jordan,
p45
aVwhere I had an amazing experience with a camel.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd we were in the desert.
p50
aa(lp51
VRichard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.
p54
aVThere were four of us, two Bedouin drivers.
p55
aVYou can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand,
p56
aV105 degrees, one water bottle.
p57
aVAnd we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep.
p58
aVDidn't look like it to me.
p59
aVAnd as we started to go through the desert,
p60
aVthe Jeep broke down.
p61
aVThe guys got out, they put the hood up,
p62
aVthey started working under the hood, got it going again.
p63
aVAbout a hundred yards, it broke down.
p64
aVThis went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed,
p65
aVwe were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd eventually, our worst nightmare happened:
p68
aVthey flooded the engine.
p69
aVAnd they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."
p70
aVAnd we said, "We get out and walk?"
p71
aVOne water bottle, remember, guys, four people.
p72
aVAnd they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk. We'll find some camels."
p73
aVWe got out and walked, and sure enough,
p74
aVabout half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill,
p75
aVand there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels.
p76
aVThe guy went up and started dickering,
p77
aVand 10 dollars later, we had four camels.
p78
aVThey went down like elevators; we got on them.
p79
aVThey went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them,
p80
aVgot behind each of the camels with a little whip.
p81
aVAnd they started slashing away at the back of the camels,
p82
aVand they started galloping.
p83
aVAnd if you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.
p84
aVThere's also one other aspect about these camels.
p85
aVAbout every 10 steps, they lean back
p86
aVand try to take a chunk out of your leg.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we kept on going,
p91
aVand this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg.
p92
aVAnd eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination,
p93
aVwhere a Jeep was supposed to meet us.
p94
aVAnd the camels come down again like elevators,
p95
aVwe sort of clumsily get off,
p96
aVand they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg.
p97
aVAnd I've developed a very wonderful relationship
p98
aVwith this creature by this point,
p99
aVand I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch.
p100
aVAnd much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me
p101
aVand tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters
p102
aVto take back to the States.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo as we talked, Richard and I,
p105
aVI said, "You know, maybe I should bring a camel.
p106
aVIt's the best designed animal in the world."
p107
aVHe went, "Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel."
p108
aVAnd you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel.
p109
aVSo I did the next best thing.
p110
aVI went to the Washington Zoo.
p111
aVRichard said, "I want you to get up close and personal with this camel.
p112
aVI want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth.
p113
aVGo underneath it. Go above it. Go around it.
p114
aVPull its tail up; take a look in there.
p115
aVI want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can."
p116
aa(lp117
VSo, I got a National Geographic film crew.
p118
aVWe went down there, and I took one look at this camel.
p119
aVIt is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut,
p124
aVit is a scary, scary thing to behold.
p125
aVAnd if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel,
p126
aVsomeone was smoking Bedouin high grade.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VSo we got as close to it as possible,
p131
aVand I'm going to share this.
p132
aVChris, if you want to roll this film.
p133
aVThen I'm going to show you
p134
aVa little bit more about the design of camels.
p135
aa(lp136
VDo you want to roll the film?
p137
aa(lp138
V(Adventure music)
p139
aa(lp140
V(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows
p141
aVwith the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit.
p142
aVI'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Music continues)
p145
aa(lp146
VKeith Bellows: And you'll note I started chewing gum
p147
aVbecause I was around this camel all day.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Video) That's it, OK. No!
p150
aVSee, now he's getting a little overexcited.
p151
aVSo we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you.
p152
aVNow, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there.
p153
aVI always called myself the unstable stable boy.
p154
aVTheir nose, you can see his nose is flared right now.
p155
aVWhen they're in rut, they're similar to seals
p156
aVin the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe.
p157
aVAnd they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose.
p158
aa(lp159
VKB: Ears?
p160
aa(lp161
VSK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing.
p162
aVBut not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear
p163
aVthat's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around.
p164
aVAnd they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision.
p165
aVThey use that to pinpoint sound.
p166
aVThe desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold.
p167
aVSo not only do they have the very long eyelashes,
p168
aVbut there's the secondary \u2014
p169
aVI guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever.
p170
aVIt's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer.
p171
aa(lp172
VMost people think that the humps store water.
p173
aVThey don't. They store fat.
p174
aVNow, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens
p175
aVis the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
p176
aVAnd that will turn it into actually usable water.
p177
aVLike a lot of predators, they walk on their toes.
p178
aVBut there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out.
p179
aVThey're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand.
p180
aVHooves? They don't have traditional hooves,
p181
aVbut they do have one, like, big nail.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Audience laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VYou can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over.
p186
aVBut they use their tails a lot, especially in rut.
p187
aVHe will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around
p188
aVand make him more attractive.
p189
aVI don't know why that would be, but it works for them.
p190
aVSo, what the hell.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Audience laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, they will also defecate in certain areas.
p195
aVGenerally, they poop wherever they want to,
p196
aVbut during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas.
p197
aVI don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,
p198
aVyou know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"
p199
aVThese big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing.
p200
aVYou can actually see, right here, it will vibrate.
p201
aVWe weigh our animals.
p202
aVUnfortunately, he's a very aggressive animal,
p203
aVso he's actually destroyed some of the scales.
p204
aVWe had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance.
p205
aVI'm guessing that he's at least 1,600 pounds.
p206
aVBut I would put him closer to 2,000.
p207
aVHe's basically a walking mulch pile.
p208
aVWe're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well.
p209
aa(lp210
VKB: He sees you as competition? Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.
p211
aVAnd it makes him very dangerous at this time of year.
p212
aVDon't even think about it. Don't think about it!
p213
aa(lp214
VBut now, we're going to meet. Out!
p215
aVOut! Out!
p216
aVNo.
p217
aVOut!
p218
aa(lp219
V(Music)
p220
aa(lp221
V(Applause)
p222
aa(lp223
VKB: What I didn't show you was, you got that swinging thing going?
p224
aVWell, and you're glad I didn't show you this.
p225
aVOne of the other things about the camel's beautiful design
p226
aVis that its penis points backwards.
p227
aVThat way the camel can dip its tail in the stream,
p228
aVand just whacker the entire area around him.
p229
aVAnd that's how he really marks his territory.
p230
aVNow, what you also didn't see was that \u2014
p231
aVand you may have noticed in the pen beside him
p232
aVand, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.
p233
aVIn the pen beside him is Jasmine.
p234
aVJasmine has been his mate for some time.
p235
aVBut on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear
p236
aVthat as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it.
p237
aVAnd so we started thinking.
p238
aVWell, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate,
p239
aVwhat would Suki do to find the perfect mate?
p240
aa(lp241
VI'm going to show you another film.
p242
aVBut before I do, I just want to mention
p243
aVthat this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand,
p244
aVthe ship of the desert.
p245
aVIt's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas
p246
aVin which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara,
p247
aVthat there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.
p248
aVAnd if this is a creature that was designed by committee,
p249
aVit's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on.
p250
aVSo here's what Suki would do in search of a mate.
p251
aVCan you roll it, please?
p252
aa(lp253
VCamel seeking camel
p254
aVLusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate.
p255
aVI'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs \u2014
p256
aVand I'm very well ... hung.
p257
aVI'm TED Camel.
p258
aVThe perfect desert machine.
p259
aVI'm smartly designed.
p260
aVEyelashes that keep out sand
p261
aVand a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper.
p262
aVA distinguished nose \u2014
p263
aVwith nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust
p264
aVand a groove that catches moisture.
p265
aVAmazingly full lips \u2014
p266
aVthat allow me to eat practically anything that grows.
p267
aVCallouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably.
p268
aVLeathery chest pads that beat the heat.
p269
aVShort fur that keeps my skin cool.
p270
aVLong legs that allow heat to escape.
p271
aVAnd my hump?
p272
aVOgden Nash once wrote:
p273
aV"The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two,
p274
aVor else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?"
p275
aVHere's a hint:
p276
aVBactarian.
p277
aVDromedary.
p278
aVMy hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn't store H2O.
p279
aVI'm built to last.
p280
aVI'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry.
p281
aVI usually won't sweat until my body reaches 105 ºF,
p282
aVenough to fry an egg.
p283
aVI'm able to lose 40% of my weight without dying.
p284
aV(Most animals would if they lost half that much.)
p285
aVI'll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day.
p286
aVBut go without for more than a month.
p287
aVI'm powerful.
p288
aVAble to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.
p289
aVOutrun a horse \u2014
p290
aVAnd cover 26 miles on a good day.
p291
aVCamelot.
p292
aVJackie O. once said that traveling by camel
p293
aVmade riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane.
p294
aVYet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand.
p295
aV(Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?)
p296
aVI'm a good provider, too.
p297
aVBedouins call the camel the Gift of God.
p298
aVNo surprise.
p299
aVTents and rugs are made of my hair.
p300
aVMy dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory.
p301
aVMy dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.
p302
aV"Camels are like angels," a Bedouin once said.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Applause)
p305
aa(lp306
VThank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought,
p307
aVwhich is probably the most important thing to take away.
p308
aVHumans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large,
p309
aVwe really don't have to adapt to our environment;
p310
aVwe adapt our environment to us.
p311
aVAnd we've seen that repeatedly through this conference,
p312
aVnot just this year, but in past years.
p313
aVBut this creature that you've just seen
p314
aVultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting.
p315
aVI think when you look at the animal kingdom,
p316
aVthat is one of the most remarkable things.
p317
aVIt doesn't have an environment that adapts to it;
p318
aVit has to adapt to the environment.
p319
aa(lp320
VRicky, thank you very much for having me.
p321
aa(lp322
VRW: That's terrific. Thank you.

design.

They returned with a film of Suki, a 2,000-pound creature in the midst of rut, with shocking capabilities lurking in his spinning tail and rear-facing genitalia, all gleefully outlined in the film.
