VWe all make decisions every day; we want to know
p5
aVwhat the right thing is to do \u2014 in domains from the financial
p6
aVto the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
p7
aVAnd surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do
p8
aVexactly the right thing at all possible times,
p9
aVthat would be a tremendous gift.
p10
aa(lp11
VIt turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738
p12
aVby a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
p13
aVAnd what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,
p14
aVand I also want to explain to you why it is
p15
aVthat it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.
p18
aVAnd if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.
p19
aVBut the simple English translation \u2014 much less precise,
p20
aVbut it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say \u2014 was this:
p21
aVThe expected value of any of our actions \u2014
p22
aVthat is, the goodness that we can count on getting \u2014
p23
aVis the product of two simple things:
p24
aVthe odds that this action will allow us to gain something,
p25
aVand the value of that gain to us.
p26
aa(lp27
VIn a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,
p28
aVif we can estimate and multiply these two things,
p29
aVwe will always know precisely how we should behave.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, this simple equation, even for those of you
p32
aVwho don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
p33
aVHere's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play
p34
aVa little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,
p35
aVand if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,
p36
aVbut you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,
p37
aVmost of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know
p38
aVthat the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,
p39
aVthat multiplies to five, and that's more
p40
aVthan I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
p41
aVThis is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,
p44
aVbut in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
p45
aVPeople are horrible at estimating both of these things,
p46
aVand that's what I want to talk to you about today.
p47
aa(lp48
VThere are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide
p49
aVwhat the right thing is to do, and those are
p50
aVerrors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,
p51
aVand errors in estimating the value of their own success.
p52
aVNow, let me talk about the first one first.
p53
aVCalculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:
p54
aVthere are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
p55
aVYou all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades
p56
aVor of flipping a heads.
p57
aVBut as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply
p58
aVin everyday life. That's why Americans spend more \u2014
p59
aVI should say, lose more \u2014 gambling
p60
aVthan on all other forms of entertainment combined.
p61
aVThe reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
p62
aa(lp63
VThe way people figure odds
p64
aVrequires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
p65
aVNow, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think
p66
aVthere are more dogs or pigs on leashes
p67
aVobserved in any particular day in Oxford.
p68
aVAnd of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
p69
aVAnd the way that you know that the answer is dogs is
p70
aVyou quickly reviewed in memory the times
p71
aVyou've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
p72
aVIt was very easy to remember seeing dogs,
p73
aVnot so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed
p74
aVthat if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,
p75
aVthen dogs on leashes are more probable.
p76
aVThat's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, for example, here's a word puzzle.
p79
aVAre there more four-letter English words
p80
aVwith R in the third place or R in the first place?
p81
aVWell, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,
p82
aVand it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,
p83
aVand very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
p84
aVBut in fact, there are many more words in the English language
p85
aVwith R in the third than the first place.
p86
aVThe reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind
p87
aVisn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
p88
aVIt's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
p89
aVYou kind of shout out the sound, S \u2014 and the word comes.
p90
aVIt's like the dictionary;
p91
aVit's hard to look things up by the third letter.
p92
aVSo, this is an example of how this idea that
p93
aVthe quickness with which things come to mind
p94
aVcan give you a sense of their probability \u2014
p95
aa(lp96
Vhow this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.
p97
aVFor example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds
p98
aVthat they will die in a variety of interesting ways \u2014
p99
aVthese are estimates of number of deaths per year
p100
aVper 200 million U.S. citizens.
p101
aVAnd these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked
p102
aVto guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.
p103
aVCompare these to the actual numbers.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,
p106
aVtwo things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.
p107
aVTwo things are vastly underestimated:
p108
aVdying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
p109
aVWhen was the last time that you picked up a newspaper
p110
aVand the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
p111
aVIt's not interesting because it's so common.
p112
aVIt's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances
p113
aVof news stories or newsreels where we've seen
p114
aVtornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck
p115
aVwho's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.
p116
aVDrownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.
p117
aVThey don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,
p118
aVwe vastly underestimate them.
p119
aa(lp120
VIndeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game
p121
aVof "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say
p122
aVit's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool
p123
aVis the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.
p124
aVThe way that more of you are likely to die than the combination
p125
aVof all three of the others that you see on the slide.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe lottery is an excellent example, of course \u2014 an excellent test-case
p128
aVof people's ability to compute probabilities.
p129
aVAnd economists \u2014 forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery \u2014
p130
aVbut economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery
p131
aVas a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff
p132
aVby investing your money in a lottery ticket
p133
aVare approximately equivalent to flushing the money
p134
aVdirectly down the toilet \u2014 which, by the way,
p135
aVdoesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.
p136
aa(lp137
VWhy in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?
p138
aVWell, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,
p139
aVwe see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,
p140
aVor Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check \u2014
p141
aVhow the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
p142
aVWe see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
p143
aVWhen was the last time that you saw extensive interviews
p144
aVwith everybody who lost?
p145
aVIndeed, if we required that television stations run
p146
aVa 30-second interview with each loser
p147
aVevery time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers
p148
aVin the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years
p149
aVof your undivided attention just to watch them say,
p150
aV"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."
p151
aVNow, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television \u2014
p152
aVno sleep, no potty breaks \u2014 and you saw loss after loss after loss,
p153
aVand then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"
p154
aVthe likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.
p155
aa(lp156
VLook, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.
p157
aVThere's 10 tickets in this lottery.
p158
aVNine of them have been sold to these individuals.
p159
aVIt costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,
p160
aVyou get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?
p161
aVWell, Bernoulli tells us it is.
p162
aVThe expected value of this lottery is two dollars;
p163
aVthis is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
p164
aVAnd most people say, "OK, I'll play."
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, a slightly different version of this lottery:
p167
aVimagine that the nine tickets are all owned
p168
aVby one fat guy named Leroy.
p169
aVLeroy has nine tickets; there's one left.
p170
aVDo you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
p171
aVNow, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,
p172
aVbut it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.
p173
aVIt's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?
p174
aVYou can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"
p175
aVbecause you're not as likely to win as Leroy.
p176
aVThe fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy
p177
aVchanges your decision to play,
p178
aVeven though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake
p181
aVcompared to trying to estimate value:
p182
aVtrying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,
p183
aVhow much pleasure it will give us.
p184
aVI want to talk now about errors in value.
p185
aVHow much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?
p186
aVMost of you have the intuition that it's not \u2014
p187
aVyou wouldn't pay that for it.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires
p190
aVthat you ask one, and only one question, which is:
p191
aVWhat else can I do with 25 dollars?
p192
aVIf you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia
p193
aVand realized that they're not going to serve you any food,
p194
aVbut somebody in the row in front of you has just opened
p195
aVthe McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches
p196
aVis wafting over the seat, you think,
p197
aVI can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.
p198
aVI can't even set it on fire \u2014 they took my cigarette lighter!
p199
aVSuddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
p200
aa(lp201
VOn the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,
p202
aVand 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.
p203
aVWhy were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,
p204
aVbefore I'd even told you anything about the context?
p205
aVBecause most of you compared the price of this Big Mac
p206
aVto the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,
p207
aV"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment
p208
aVto other possible investments, you compared to the past.
p209
aVAnd this is a systematic error people make.
p210
aVWhat you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing
p213
aVthe kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
p214
aVFor example, this is, of course,
p215
aVone of the most delicious tricks in marketing,
p216
aVis to say something used to be higher,
p217
aVand suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
p218
aVWhen people are asked about these two different jobs:
p219
aVa job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,
p220
aVa job where you're getting a salary cut each year,
p221
aVand one in which you're getting a salary increase,
p222
aVpeople like the second job better than the first, despite the fact
p223
aVthey're all told they make much less money. Why?
p224
aVBecause they had the sense that declining wages are worse
p225
aVthan rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher
p226
aVin the declining period. Here's another nice example.
p227
aa(lp228
VHere's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.
p229
aVAssuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
p230
aVMost people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:
p231
aV$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,
p232
aVso you decide to mull it over for a week.
p233
aVBy the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone \u2014
p234
aVthe package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
p235
aVWhy? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500
p236
aVfor something that was 700 last week.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis tendency to compare to the past
p239
aVis causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,
p240
aVa good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good
p241
aVas an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
p242
aa(lp243
VHere's another example of how comparing to the past
p244
aVcan befuddle our decisions.
p245
aVImagine that you're going to the theater.
p246
aVYou're on your way to the theater.
p247
aVIn your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.
p248
aVYou also have a 20-dollar bill.
p249
aVWhen you arrive at the theater,
p250
aVyou discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
p251
aVWould you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
p252
aVMost people answer, no.
p253
aVNow, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
p254
aVYou're on your way to the theater,
p255
aVand in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.
p256
aVWhen you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
p257
aVWould you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?
p258
aVWell, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.
p259
aVWhat does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, just in case you're not getting it,
p262
aVhere's a schematic of what happened, OK?
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVAlong the way, you lost something.
p265
aVIn both cases, it was a piece of paper.
p266
aVIn one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
p267
aVWhat the hell difference should it make?
p268
aVThe difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,
p269
aVI'm not paying twice for the same thing.
p270
aVYou compare the cost of the play now \u2014 40 dollars \u2014
p271
aVto the cost that it used to have \u2014 20 dollars \u2014 and you say it's a bad deal.
p272
aVComparing with the past causes many of the problems
p273
aVthat behavioral economists and psychologists identify
p274
aVin people's attempts to assign value.
p275
aVBut even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,
p276
aVwe still make certain kinds of mistakes.
p277
aVAnd I'm going to show you one or two of them.
p278
aa(lp279
VOne of the things we know about comparison:
p280
aVthat when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
p281
aVSo in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were
p282
aVkind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,
p283
aVdidn't seem like such a great guy.
p284
aVSuddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVThe comparison changes how we evaluate him.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,
p289
aVand they use this wisdom to help you \u2014
p290
aVspare you the undue burden of money.
p291
aVAnd so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop
p292
aVand you had to buy a bottle of wine,
p293
aVand you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?
p294
aVMost people don't want the most expensive,
p295
aVthey don't want the least expensive.
p296
aVSo, they will opt for the item in the middle.
p297
aVIf you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item
p298
aVthat nobody will ever buy on the shelf,
p299
aVbecause suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo I'm telling you something you already knew:
p302
aVnamely, that comparison changes the value of things.
p303
aVHere's why that's a problem:
p304
aVthe problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,
p305
aVit won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.
p306
aVThe comparisons we make when we are appraising value,
p307
aVwhere we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,
p308
aVare not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
p309
aVThis problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil
p310
aVour attempts to make rational decisions.
p311
aa(lp312
VLet me just give you an example.
p313
aVI have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
p314
aVThese are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked
p315
aVthe simplest of all questions:
p316
aVHow much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?
p317
aVThey're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
p318
aVFor some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room
p319
aVis a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.
p320
aVIn fact, these items that are sitting in the room change
p321
aVhow much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
p322
aVNamely, those who are looking at Spam
p323
aVthink potato chips are going to be quite tasty;
p324
aVthose who are looking at Godiva chocolate
p325
aVthink they won't be nearly so tasty.
p326
aVOf course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
p327
aVWell, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that
p328
aVwhen you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,
p329
aVwhat's sitting in the corner of the room
p330
aVmakes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
p331
aVNonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison
p332
aVthat then does not carry through and change their experience.
p333
aa(lp334
VYou've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come
p335
aVinto our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:
p336
aVYou want to buy a car stereo.
p337
aVThe dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,
p338
aVbut if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
p339
aVSo would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
p340
aVMost people say they would.
p341
aVThey can't imagine buying it for twice the price
p342
aVwhen, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
p343
aa(lp344
VNow, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,
p345
aVand the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
p346
aVBut if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
p347
aVWould you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings \u2014 the 100 dollars.
p348
aVMost people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town
p349
aVto save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?
p350
aa(lp351
VThis kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.
p352
aVBecause this 100 dollars that you save \u2014 hello! \u2014
p353
aVdoesn't know where it came from.
p354
aVIt doesn't know what you saved it on.
p355
aVWhen you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,
p356
aVI'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,
p357
aVI'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.
p358
aVAnd if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks
p359
aVno matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.
p360
aVThat's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager
p361
aVis taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,
p362
aVbut they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.
p363
aa(lp364
VNow, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,
p365
aVbecause what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks
p366
aVto the purchase that you're making,
p367
aVbut when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
p368
aVYou've all had this experience.
p369
aa(lp370
VIf you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.
p371
aVAnd at some point you may have met a couple
p372
aVfrom your own hometown, and you thought,
p373
aV"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.
p374
aVI mean, compared to all these people who hate me
p375
aVwhen I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,
p376
aVthese people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,
p377
aVand then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,
p378
aVand what do you find?
p379
aVCompared to your regular friends,
p380
aVthey are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,
p381
aVthe comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself
p382
aVdisliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.
p385
aVYou go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers \u2014
p386
aVthese big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,
p387
aVand you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:
p388
aVthe big ones sound a little better.
p389
aVAnd so you buy them, and you bring them home,
p390
aVand you entirely violate the décor of your house.
p391
aVAnd the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store
p392
aVis a comparison you'll never make again.
p393
aVWhat are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,
p394
aV"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"
p395
aVwhich you can't even remember hearing.
p396
aa(lp397
VThe problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult
p398
aVwhen these choices are arrayed over time.
p399
aVPeople have a lot of trouble making decisions
p400
aVabout things that will happen at different points in time.
p401
aVAnd what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered
p402
aVis that by and large people use two simple rules.
p403
aVSo let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem
p404
aVand then a third, hard, problem.
p405
aa(lp406
VHere's the first easy problem:
p407
aVYou can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?
p408
aVThis is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
p409
aVAll of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,
p410
aVwe believe more is better than less.
p411
aa(lp412
VHere's the second problem:
p413
aVYou can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
p414
aVAgain, an easy decision,
p415
aVbecause we all know that now is better than later.
p416
aVWhat's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.
p417
aVFor example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.
p418
aVThis typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain
p419
aVby waiting, but you have to be patient.
p420
aVWhat do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
p421
aVWell, by and large people are enormously impatient.
p422
aVThat is, they require interest rates in the hundred
p423
aVor thousands of percents in order to delay gratification
p424
aVand wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
p425
aVMaybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is
p426
aVhow easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing
p427
aVwhen the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
p428
aVImagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year \u2014 that's 12 months \u2014
p429
aVor 60 dollars in 13 months.
p430
aVWhat do we find now?
p431
aVPeople are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,
p432
aVthey might as well wait 13.
p433
aa(lp434
VWhat makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?
p435
aVComparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.
p436
aa(lp437
VThis is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested
p438
aVyou would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,
p439
aVpeople find that the subjective value of 50 is higher
p440
aVthan the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now
p441
aVor one month, respectively \u2014 a 30-day delay \u2014
p442
aVbut they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision
p443
aVoff into the future a year.
p444
aVNow, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?
p445
aa(lp446
VThese guys can tell us.
p447
aVWhat you see here are two lads,
p448
aVone of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.
p449
aVThey are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,
p450
aVand I want you to notice two things.
p451
aVAt no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.
p452
aVHowever, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
p453
aVFirst it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,
p454
aVthen a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.
p455
aa(lp456
VHere are the results of what I just showed you.
p457
aVThis is the subjective height \u2014
p458
aVthe height you saw of these guys at various points.
p459
aVAnd I want you to see that two things are true.
p460
aVOne, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;
p461
aVand two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.
p462
aVBut watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.
p463
aVAt a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,
p464
aVbut at a far distance
p465
aVtheir normal, their true, relations are preserved.
p466
aVAs Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
p467
aVThese are the results of the hard problem I gave you:
p468
aV60 now or 50 in a month?
p469
aVAnd these are subjective values,
p470
aVand what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.
p471
aa(lp472
VPeople always think more is better than less:
p473
aV60 is always better than 50,
p474
aVand they always think now is better than later:
p475
aVthe bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.
p476
aVWatch what happens when we drop some out.
p477
aVSuddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.
p478
aVWe have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now
p479
aVover waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.
p480
aVNotice something interesting that this implies \u2014 namely, that
p481
aVwhen people get to the future, they will change their minds.
p482
aVThat is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,
p483
aVwhat was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
p484
aVI'll take the 50 dollars now.
p485
aa(lp486
VWell, the question with which I'd like to end is this:
p487
aVIf we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
p488
aVBecause I could go on for about two hours with evidence
p489
aVof people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.
p490
aa(lp491
VThe answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard
p492
aVin some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:
p493
aVnamely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world
p494
aVthan the one in which we are living.
p495
aVThey were evolved for a world
p496
aVin which people lived in very small groups,
p497
aVrarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,
p498
aVhad rather short lives in which there were few choices
p499
aVand the highest priority was to eat and mate today.
p500
aa(lp501
VBernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us
p502
aVhow we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.
p503
aVThat explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains
p504
aVwhy it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.
p505
aVWe are the only species on this planet
p506
aVthat has ever held its own fate in its hands.
p507
aVWe have no significant predators,
p508
aVwe're the masters of our physical environment;
p509
aVthe things that normally cause species to become extinct
p510
aVare no longer any threat to us.
p511
aVThe only thing \u2014 the only thing \u2014 that can destroy us and doom us
p512
aVare our own decisions.
p513
aVIf we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because
p514
aVwe could not take advantage of the gift given to us
p515
aVby a young Dutch fellow in 1738,
p516
aVbecause we underestimated the odds of our future pains
p517
aVand overestimated the value of our present pleasures.
p518
aa(lp519
VThank you.
p520
aV(Applause)
p521
aa(lp522
VChris Anderson: That was remarkable.
p523
aVWe have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.
p524
aa(lp525
VBill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism
p526
aVis in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,
p527
aVand is there some way that we could counteract that?
p528
aa(lp529
VDan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently
p530
aVwith the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes
p531
aVthat American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
p532
aVI tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name
p533
aVbased on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,
p534
aVand that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask
p535
aVwhat causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,
p536
aVrather than \u2014 not rather than, but in addition to
p537
aVstopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.
p538
aVSurely the kinds of play that at least American media give to \u2014
p539
aVand forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
p540
aVWe already know, for example, in the United States,
p541
aVmore people have died as a result of not taking airplanes \u2014
p542
aVbecause they were scared \u2014 and driving on highways,
p543
aVthan were killed in 9/11. OK?
p544
aVIf I told you that there was a plague
p545
aVthat was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,
p546
aVyou might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.
p547
aVThese are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering
p548
aVwhether they should get the kind of play,
p549
aVthe kind of coverage, that they do.
p550
aVSurely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood
p551
aVthat they'll be hurt in these various ways,
p552
aVand gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
p553
aa(lp554
VCA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying
p555
aVthat our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
p556
aVTalk more about it.
p557
aa(lp558
VDG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.
p559
aVIf Australia disappears tomorrow,
p560
aVterror is probably the right response.
p561
aVThat's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,
p562
aVwhen a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,
p563
aVmore people than that were killed
p564
aVby not using their seatbelts in the same country.
p565
aVIs terror the right response?
p566
aa(lp567
VCA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event \u2014
p568
aVthat it's so spectacular?
p569
aVIs it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
p570
aVWhat is it?
p571
aa(lp572
VDG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.
p573
aVFirst, it's a human agent trying to kill us \u2014
p574
aVit's not a tree falling on us by accident.
p575
aVSecond, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
p576
aVPeople are being killed for no reason instead of good reason \u2014
p577
aVas if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
p578
aVSo there are a number of things that together
p579
aVmake this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down
p580
aVthe fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it
p581
aVthey want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,
p582
aVwho want these things to be
p583
aVas spectacular as they possibly can.
p584
aa(lp585
VCA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?
p586
aa(lp587
VDG: Well, go to Israel. You know,
p588
aVgo to Israel. And a mall blows up,
p589
aVand then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later \u2014
p590
aVat least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall
p591
aVwhen it blew up \u2014 I went back to my hotel
p592
aVand the wedding that was planned was still going on.
p593
aVAnd as the Israeli mother said,
p594
aVshe said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."
p595
aVI mean, this is a society that has learned \u2014
p596
aVand there are others too \u2014 that has learned to live
p597
aVwith a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,
p598
aVshall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.
p599
aa(lp600
VCA: But is there a rational fear that actually,
p601
aVthe reason we're frightened about this is because we think that
p602
aVthe Big One is to come?
p603
aa(lp604
VDG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack
p605
aVthere would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people \u2014
p606
aVwe would probably not be nearly so frightened.
p607
aVI don't want to say \u2014 please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere
p608
aVas saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."
p609
aVThat's not my point at all.
p610
aVWhat I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,
p611
aVour distress about things that happen, about threats,
p612
aVshould be roughly proportional to the size of those threats
p613
aVand threats to come.
p614
aVI think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
p615
aVAnd many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today \u2014
p616
aVhow many people do you know got up and said,
p617
aVPoverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
p618
aVPeople get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
p619
aVIt's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
p620
aVThere are no guns going off.
p621
aVI mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,
p622
aVwhich would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?
p623
aV(Laughter)
p624
aV(Applause)
p625
aVThat's a tough one.
p626
aa(lp627
VCA: There's no question.
p628
aVPoverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,
p629
aVunless someone can show that there's, you know,
p630
aVterrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
p631
aVThe latest I've read, seen, thought
p632
aVis that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.
p633
aVIf that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,
p634
aVbut with poverty it's a bit \u2014
p635
aa(lp636
VDG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.
p637
aa(lp638
VCA: We've evolved to get all excited
p639
aVabout these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,
p640
aVin the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease
p641
aVand systems that cause poverty and so forth,
p642
aVand so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy
p643
aVinto worrying about those things?
p644
aVPeople died; so be it.
p645
aVBut if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.
p646
aVAnd so we evolved these responses.
p647
aVIs that what happened?
p648
aa(lp649
VDG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical
p650
aVabout leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything
p651
aVare the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
p652
aVMy guess is that there's nothing quite that specific
p653
aVin our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for
p654
aVan evolutionary explanation, you might say
p655
aVthat most organisms are neo-phobic \u2014 that is, they're a little scared
p656
aVof stuff that's new and different.
p657
aVAnd there's a good reason to be,
p658
aVbecause old stuff didn't eat you. Right?
p659
aVAny animal you see that you've seen before is less likely
p660
aVto be a predator than one that you've never seen before.
p661
aVSo, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,
p662
aVour general tendency is to orient towards
p663
aVthat which is new and novel is activated.
p664
aVI don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism
p665
aVas the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.
p666
aa(lp667
VJay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about
p668
aVthe stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect
p669
aVyou're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,
p670
aVwhich is the error of value.
p671
aVI know, because I've interviewed
p672
aVabout 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
p673
aVIt turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
p674
aVThat's what you think it is. All right?
p675
aVThe average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,
p676
aVso the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,
p677
aVand yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
p678
aVIt's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
p679
aVIt's because the anticipation of possibly winning
p680
aVreleases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling
p681
aVuntil the drawing indicates you've lost.
p682
aVOr, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,
p683
aVyou can have a much better feeling than flushing the money
p684
aVdown the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
p685
aVNow, economists tend to \u2014
p686
aV(Applause)
p687
aV\u2014 economists tend to view the world
p688
aVthrough their own lenses, which is:
p689
aVthis is just a bunch of stupid people.
p690
aVAnd as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
p691
aVAnd so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,
p692
aVwe didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.
p693
aV(Applause)
p694
aa(lp695
VDG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen
p696
aVwhether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled
p697
aVby the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,
p698
aVpeople who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,
p699
aVeven though they don't feel great during the drawing.
p700
aVI would disagree that people know they're not going to win.
p701
aVI think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,
p702
aVwhich is why they prefer that to the flushing.
p703
aVBut certainly I see your point: that there can be
p704
aVsome utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
p705
aVNow, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.
p706
aVThat isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
p707
aa(lp708
VCA: Last question.
p709
aa(lp710
VAubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.
p711
aVI work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills \u2014
p712
aVI work on aging \u2014 and I'm interested in doing something about it,
p713
aVas we'll all hear tomorrow.
p714
aVI very much resonate with what you're saying,
p715
aVbecause it seems to me that the problem
p716
aVwith getting people interested in doing anything about aging
p717
aVis that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer
p718
aVor heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
p719
aV(Laughter)
p720
aa(lp721
VDG: For you or for them?
p722
aa(lp723
VAdG: In persuading them.
p724
aa(lp725
VDG: Ah, for you in persuading them.
p726
aVWell, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
p727
aVBut one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work
p728
aVis to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
p729
aVOne of the problems with making decisions about the far future
p730
aVand the near future is that we imagine the near future
p731
aVmuch more vividly than the far future.
p732
aVTo the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail
p733
aVthat people put into the mental representations
p734
aVof near and far future, people begin to make decisions
p735
aVabout the two in the same way.
p736
aVSo, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65
p737
aVis a question that's very different than,
p738
aVimagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,
p739
aVwhat will you look like, how much hair will you have,
p740
aVwho will you be living with.
p741
aVOnce we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,
p742
aVsuddenly we feel like it might be important to save
p743
aVso that that guy has a little retirement money.
p744
aVBut these are tricks around the margins.
p745
aVI think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,
p746
aVwhich is to say, "I'm here today,
p747
aVand so now is more important than later."
p748
aa(lp749
VCA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience,
p750
aVthat was a fantastic session. Thank you.

In the same way that optical illusions fool our eyes -- and fool everyone&#39;s eyes in the same way -- Gilbert argues that <strong>our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy</strong>. And these quirks in our cognition make humans very poor predictors of our own bliss.<br /><br />The premise of his current research -- that our assumptions about what will make us happy are often wrong -- is supported with clinical research drawn from psychology and neuroscience. But his delivery is what sets him apart. His engaging -- and often hilarious -- style pokes fun at typical human behavior and invokes pop-culture references everyone can relate to. This winning style translates also to Gilbert&#39;s writing, which is <strong>lucid, approachable and laugh-out-loud funny</strong>. The immensely readable <em><a href=\\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Stumbling on Happiness</a>,</em> published in 2006, became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and has been translated into 20 languages.<br /><br />In fact, the title of his book could be drawn from his own life. At 19, he was a high school dropout with dreams of writing science fiction. When a creative writing class at his community college was full, he enrolled in the only available course: psychology. He found his passion there, earned a doctorate in social psychology in 1985 at Princeton, and has since won a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching prize for his work at Harvard. He has written essays and articles for <em>The New York Times, Time</em> and even <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/STARBUCKS%20CUP.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Starbucks</a>, while <strong>continuing his research into happiness at his <a href=\\"http://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/gilbert.htm\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hedonic Psychology Laboratory</a>.</strong></p>", "slug": "dan_gilbert", "whotheyare": "Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says our beliefs about what will make us happy are often wrong -- a premise he supports with intriguing research, and explains in his accessible and unexpectedly funny book, <em>Stumbling on Happiness.</em>", "whatotherssay": "Gilbert\'s elbow-in-the-ribs social-science humor is actually funny. ...
