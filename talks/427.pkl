(lp4
VI'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,
p5
aVso I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.
p6
aVSo, I'm going to, like, go through some slides
p7
aVfrom way back when,
p8
aVand walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, basically it all began with
p11
aVthis whole idea of a computer.
p12
aVWho has a computer? Yeah.
p13
aVO.K., so, everyone has a computer.
p14
aVEven a mobile phone, it's a computer.
p15
aVAnd \u2014 anyone remember this workbook,
p16
aV"Instant Activities for Your Apple" \u2014
p17
aVfree poster in each book?
p18
aVThis was how computing began.
p19
aVDon't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.
p20
aVYou'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in,
p21
aVand it would do absolutely nothing at all.
p22
aVSo, you had to program it,
p23
aVand there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.
p24
aVI mean, this was great.
p25
aVIt's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.
p26
aVIt's such a great way to \u2014
p27
aVI mean, they should make Java books like this,
p28
aVand we've have no problem learning a program.
p29
aVBut this was a great, grand time of the computer,
p30
aVwhen it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.
p31
aVAnd, you see,
p32
aVthis era coincided with my own childhood.
p33
aa(lp34
VI grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
p35
aVWho of you grew up in a family business,
p36
aVsuffered the torture? Yes, yes.
p37
aVThe torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?
p38
aVIt was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;
p39
aVit was a family business.
p40
aVAnd my mother was a kind of a designer, also.
p41
aVShe'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,
p42
aVand it would confuse the customers,
p43
aVbecause they all thought it was a restaurant.
p44
aVA bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.
p45
aVBut, anyway, that's where I grew up,
p46
aVin this little tofu factory in Seattle,
p47
aVand it was kind of like this:
p48
aVa small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.
p49
aa(lp50
VThat's my dad. My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really:
p51
aVhe would invent, like, ways to make things heavy.
p52
aVLike back here, there's like, concrete block technology here,
p53
aVand he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,
p54
aVbecause tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,
p55
aVand so you have to have heavy stuff
p56
aVto push out the liquid and make it hard.
p57
aVTofu comes out in these big batches,
p58
aVand my father would sort of cut them by hand.
p59
aVI can't tell you \u2014 family business story: you'd understand this \u2014
p60
aVmy father was the most sincere man possible.
p61
aVHe walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,
p62
aVslipped, broke his arm, rushed out:
p63
aVhe didn't want to inconvenience Safeway.
p64
aVSo, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken
p65
aVfor two weeks in the store, and that week \u2014
p66
aVnow, those two weeks were when my older brother and I
p67
aVhad to do everything.
p68
aVAnd that was torture, real torture.
p69
aVBecause, you see, we'd seen my father
p70
aVtaking the big block of tofu and cutting it,
p71
aVlike, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.
p72
aVSo, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.
p73
aVBad blocks. But anyways,
p74
aVthe tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.
p75
aVAnd because working in a store was so hard,
p76
aVI liked going to school; it was like heaven.
p77
aVAnd I was really good at school.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo, when I got to MIT, you know,
p80
aVas most of you who are creatives,
p81
aVyour parents all told you not to be creative, right?
p82
aVSo, same way, you know,
p83
aVI was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's \u2014
p84
aVJohn's good at math.
p85
aVI went to MIT, did my math,
p86
aVbut I had this wonderful opportunity,
p87
aVbecause computers had just become visual.
p88
aVThe Apple \u2014 Macintosh just came out;
p89
aVI had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.
p90
aVAnd it was a time when a guy who, kind of,
p91
aVcould cross the two sides \u2014
p92
aVit was a good time.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd so, I remember that my first major piece of software
p95
aVwas on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.
p96
aVI made a desktop publishing system way back when,
p97
aVand that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to \u2014
p98
aVoh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.
p99
aVAnd the problem when you're younger \u2014
p100
aVfor all you students out there \u2014
p101
aVis, your head gets kind of big really easy.
p102
aVAnd when I was making icons, I was, like,
p103
aVthe icon master,
p104
aVand I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know.
p105
aVAnd then luckily, you know,
p106
aVI had the fortune of going to something called a library,
p107
aVand in the library I came upon this very book.
p108
aVI found this book. It's called,
p109
aV"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.
p110
aVIt's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.
p111
aVIt's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand,
p112
aVwho was one of the greatest graphic designers,
p113
aVand also a great writer as well.
p114
aVAnd when I saw this man's work,
p115
aVI realized how bad I was at design,
p116
aVor whatever I called it back then,
p117
aVand I suddenly had a kind of career goal,
p118
aVkind of in hot pursuit.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I kind of switched. I went to MIT, finished.
p121
aVI got my masters, and then went to art school after that.
p122
aVAnd just began to design stuff,
p123
aVlike chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus \u2014 whatever I could get a handle on:
p124
aVsort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.
p125
aVAnd isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?
p126
aVRemember that moment \u2014 publishing your designs?
p127
aVRemember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it?
p128
aVSo, I was published, you know,
p129
aVso, wow, my design's in a book, you know?
p130
aVAfter that, things kind of got strange,
p131
aVand I got thinking about the computer,
p132
aVbecause the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.
p133
aVI didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand
p134
aVwas a kind of crusty designer,
p135
aVyou know, a crusty designer, like a good \u2014 kind of like a good French bread?
p136
aVYou know, he wrote in one of his books:
p137
aV"A Yale student once said,
p138
aV'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.'
p139
aVDesign schools take heed."
p140
aVThis is in the '80s,
p141
aVin the great clash of computer/non-computer people.
p142
aVA very difficult time, actually.
p143
aVAnd this to me was an important message from Rand.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd so I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.
p146
aVThis is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.
p147
aVI built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.
p148
aVIt looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.
p149
aVIt was very hard to make this, actually.
p150
aVIt took a month to make this part.
p151
aVAnd then I thought, what if I added this feature,
p152
aVwhere I can say, this point,
p153
aVyou can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.
p154
aVSo I could, sort of, change the kind of stability
p155
aVwith a little control there on the dial,
p156
aVand I can sort of watch it flip around.
p157
aVAnd this is in 1993.
p158
aVAnd when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.
p159
aVThey were saying, Why's it moving?
p160
aVThey were saying, Make it stop now.
p161
aVNow, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.
p162
aVAnd he says, Well, when's it going to stop?
p163
aVAnd I said, Never.
p164
aVAnd he said, Even worse. Stop it now.
p165
aVI started studying this whole idea,
p166
aVof like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.
p167
aVIt's not like print. It's not like video.
p168
aVIt lasts forever. It's a very strange medium.
p169
aVSo, I went off with this,
p170
aVand began to look for things even more.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd so in Japan, I began to experiment with people.
p173
aVThis is actually bad: human experiments.
p174
aVI would do these things where I'd have students become pens:
p175
aVthere's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.
p176
aVAnd someone sits down and draws a picture.
p177
aVThey're laughing because he said,
p178
aVdraw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.
p179
aVSee, humans don't know how to take orders;
p180
aVthe computer's so good at it.
p181
aVThis guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:
p182
aVyou know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.
p183
aVAnd so began to have multiple pens on the page \u2014
p184
aVagain, hard to do with our hands.
p185
aVAnd then someone discovered this "a-ha moment"
p186
aVwhere you could use coordinate systems.
p187
aVWe thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen.
p188
aVIn the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.
p189
aVIt became computerish; we began to think computerish \u2014
p190
aVthe X, Y system \u2014 and so that was kind of a revelation.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd after this I wanted to build a computer out of people,
p193
aVcalled a human-powered computer.
p194
aVSo, this happened in 1993.
p195
aVSound down, please.
p196
aVIt's a computer where the people are the parts.
p197
aVI have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,
p198
aVa graphics card, a memory system.
p199
aVThey're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.
p200
aVIt's put inside the computer.
p201
aVAnd that little program's on that cardboard disk.
p202
aVSo, she wears the disk,
p203
aVand reads the data off the sectors of the disk,
p204
aVand the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.
p205
aVAnd it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,
p206
aVI had a moment of \u2014 what is it called? \u2014
p207
aVthe epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast.
p208
aVThis computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,
p209
aVand people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.
p210
aVAnd this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,
p211
aVif you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.
p212
aVOn the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.
p213
aVOn this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour
p214
aVfor the mouse cursor to change.
p215
aVTo give you a sense of the speed, the scale:
p216
aVthe computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd so, after this I began to do experiments for different companies.
p219
aVThis is something I did for Sony in 1996.
p220
aVIt was three Sony "H" devices
p221
aVthat responded to sound.
p222
aVSo, if you talk into the mike,
p223
aVyou'll hear some music in your headphones;
p224
aVif you talk in the phone, then video would happen.
p225
aVSo, I began to experiment with industry in different ways
p226
aVwith this kind of mixture of skills.
p227
aVI did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.
p228
aVAnd Chanel. So, getting to do different projects.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd also, one thing I realized is that
p231
aVI like to make things.
p232
aVWe like to make things. It's fun to make things.
p233
aVAnd so I never developed the ability to have a staff.
p234
aVI have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand \u2014
p235
aVthese sort of broken hands.
p236
aVAnd these hands were influenced
p237
aVby this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.
p238
aVThis guy was my kind of like mentor.
p239
aVHe was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.
p240
aVHe's the guy that kind of discovered me,
p241
aVand kind of got me going in digital media.
p242
aVHe was such an inspirational guy.
p243
aVI remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,
p244
aVand then he'd show up from some client meeting.
p245
aVHe'd come in and say, you know,
p246
aVIf I am here, everything is okay.
p247
aVAnd you'd feel so much better, you know.
p248
aVAnd I'll never forget how, like, but \u2014 I'll never forget how, like,
p249
aVhe had a sudden situation with his \u2014 he had an aneurysm.
p250
aVHe went into a coma.
p251
aVAnd so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,
p252
aVand so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow \u2014
p253
aVhow fragile is this thing we're wearing,
p254
aVthis body and mind we're wearing,
p255
aVand so I thought, How do you go for it more?
p256
aVHow do you take that time you have left and go after it?
p257
aVSo, Naomi was pivotal in that.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.
p260
aVThis was a moment where I was thinking about,
p261
aVso, you have a computer program,
p262
aVit responds to motion \u2014 X and Y \u2014
p263
aVand I realized that each computer program
p264
aVhas all these images inside the program.
p265
aVSo, if you can see here, you know,
p266
aVthat program you're seeing in the corner,
p267
aVif you spread it out, it's all these things all at once.
p268
aVIt's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with.
p269
aVWe're so used to working in one vector.
p270
aVThis is all at the same time.
p271
aVThe computer lives in so many dimensions.
p272
aVAnd also, at the same time I was frustrated,
p273
aVbecause I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,
p274
aVand there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know,
p275
aVand this is, like, in the late 1990s,
p276
aVand this is in Basel,
p277
aVa great graphic design school.
p278
aVAnd here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,
p279
aVkind of, dark computer room.
p280
aVAnd I began to wonder, Is this the goal?
p281
aVIs this what we want, you know?
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd also, I began to be fascinated by machines \u2014
p284
aVyou know, like copy machines \u2014 and so this is actually in Basel.
p285
aVI noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive \u2014
p286
aVthis is, like, a touch screen \u2014
p287
aVand I noticed how you can only touch five places,
p288
aVand so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?"
p289
aVbecame a question. And also, the sound:
p290
aVI discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone.
p291
aVYou get it? No? O.K.
p292
aVAnd also, I discovered in Logan airport,
p293
aVthis was, like, calling out to me.
p294
aVDo you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo, I was wondering, like,
p297
aVwhat is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?
p298
aVIt didn't make any sense.
p299
aVSo, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects
p300
aVmade of old computers from my basement.
p301
aVI made \u2014 I took my old Macintoshes
p302
aVand made different objects out of them from Tokyo.
p303
aVI began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,
p304
aVso I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.
p305
aVI made this series of works.
p306
aVThey're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle
p307
aVas a kind of display that's sort of thinking,
p308
aVI'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.
p309
aVAnd so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction.
p310
aa(lp311
VI began to be fascinated by plastic,
p312
aVso I spent four months making eight plastic blocks
p313
aVperfectly optically transparent,
p314
aVas a kind of release of stress.
p315
aVBecause of that, I became interested in blue tape,
p316
aVso in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.
p317
aVI made a whole installation out of blue tape \u2014 blue painters' tape.
p318
aVAnd at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,
p319
aVso I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,
p320
aVWell, what else is there in life?
p321
aVAnd so computers, as you know,
p322
aVthese big computers, there are now tiny computers.
p323
aVThey're littler computers, so the one-chip computers,
p324
aVI began to program one-chip computers
p325
aVand make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.
p326
aVI began to make LED sculptures
p327
aVthat would live inside little boxes out of MDF.
p328
aVThis is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.
p329
aVVery simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.
p330
aVThis is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:
p331
aVit's sort of a plastic rice lamp;
p332
aVit's very friendly.
p333
aVI did a show in London last year made out of iPods \u2014
p334
aVI used iPods as a material.
p335
aVSo I took 16 iPod Nanos
p336
aVand made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.
p337
aVRecently, this is for Reebok.
p338
aVI've done shoes for Reebok as well,
p339
aVas a kind of a hobby for apparel.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo anyways, there are all these things you can do,
p342
aVbut the thing I love the most is to
p343
aVexperience, taste the world.
p344
aVThe world is just so tasty.
p345
aVWe think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are.
p346
aVNo, they're all out there.
p347
aVSo, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,
p348
aVactually, around the Louvre area.
p349
aVThis I found, where nature had made a picture for me.
p350
aVThis is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.
p351
aVIn this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.
p352
aVWe all are creative people.
p353
aVWe have this gene defect in our mind.
p354
aVWe can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.
p355
aVIt's the forever-always-on museum.
p356
aVThis is from the Cape last year.
p357
aVI discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,
p358
aVwhich we know as circle-triangle-square.
p359
aVIt's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.
p360
aVI began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.
p361
aVI put these all back, by the way.
p362
aVAnd I also discovered how .
p363
aVsome rocks are twins separated at birth.
p364
aVThis is also out there, you know.
p365
aVI'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?
p366
aVI brought you guys together again.
p367
aa(lp368
VSo, three years ago I discovered, the letters M-I-T
p369
aVoccurring in simplicity and complexity.
p370
aVMy alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment \u2014
p371
aVa kind of M. Night Shayamalan moment \u2014
p372
aVwhere I thought, Whoa! I have to do this.
p373
aVAnd I went after it with passion.
p374
aVHowever, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose \u2014
p375
aVgoing to RISD \u2014 and I couldn't reconcile this real easy,
p376
aVbecause the letters had told me, MIT forever.
p377
aVBut I discovered in the French word raison d'être.
p378
aVI was, like, aha, wait a second.
p379
aVAnd there RISD appeared.
p380
aVAnd so I realized it was O.K. to go.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo, I'm going to RISD, actually.
p383
aVWho's a RISD alum out there?
p384
aVRISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.
p385
aVI'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center \u2014 Art Center is good, too.
p386
aVRISD is kind of my new kind of passion,
p387
aVand I'll tell you a little bit about that.
p388
aVSo, RISD is \u2014
p389
aVI was outside RISD,
p390
aVand some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,
p391
aVWow, RISD wants to know what itself is.
p392
aVAnd I have no idea what RISD should be, actually,
p393
aVor what it wants to be, but one thing I have to tell you is that
p394
aValthough I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.
p395
aVIt's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever.
p396
aVPeople say,
p397
aVAre you going to bring RISD into the future?
p398
aVAnd I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD.
p399
aa(lp400
VThere's my perspective. Because in reality,
p401
