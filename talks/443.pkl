VSheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
p5
aa(lp6
VSS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit,
p7
aVand I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
p8
aa(lp9
VAM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio \u2014
p10
aVit might have given it away \u2014
p11
aVI'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.
p12
aVI was amputated at age one,
p13
aVand I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.
p14
aa(lp15
VSS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown \u2014 why don't we start there?
p16
aVWhy don't we start there?
p17
aa(lp18
VAM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.
p19
aVI won a full academic scholarship out of high school.
p20
aVThey pick three students out of the nation every year
p21
aVto get involved in international affairs,
p22
aVand so I won a full ride to Georgetown
p23
aVand I've been there for four years. Love it.
p24
aa(lp25
VSS: When Aimee got there,
p26
aVshe decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field,
p27
aVso she decided to call someone and start asking about it.
p28
aVSo, why don't you tell that story?
p29
aa(lp30
VAM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.
p31
aVI played softball for five years growing up.
p32
aVI skied competitively throughout high school,
p33
aVand I got a little restless in college
p34
aVbecause I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.
p35
aVAnd I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know \u2014
p36
aVI'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
p37
aVThat's all I'd ever known.
p38
aVIn fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.
p39
aVAnd I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,
p40
aVand I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this,
p41
aVbut before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."
p42
aVSo, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old
p43
aVand definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.
p44
aVI went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet
p45
aVto see how far I could run,
p46
aVand about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
p47
aVAnd I had these legs that were made of
p48
aVa wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps \u2014
p49
aVbig, thick, five-ply wool socks on \u2014
p50
aVyou know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I'm up there in Boston against people
p53
aVwearing legs made of all things \u2014 carbon graphite
p54
aVand, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things \u2014
p55
aVand they're all looking at me like,
p56
aVOK, we know who's not going to win this race.
p57
aVAnd, I mean, I went up there expecting \u2014
p58
aVI don't know what I was expecting \u2014
p59
aVbut, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg
p60
aVgo up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump
p61
aVand clear it at six feet, two inches ...
p62
aVDan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta,
p63
aVI mean, if it just gives you a comparison of \u2014
p64
aVthese are truly accomplished athletes,
p65
aVwithout qualifying that word "athlete."
p66
aVAnd so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,
p67
aVI ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder
p68
aVby three hundredths of a second,
p69
aVand became the new national record-holder on my first try out.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd, you know, people said,
p72
aV"Aimee, you know, you've got speed \u2014 you've got natural speed \u2014
p73
aVbut you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.
p74
aVYou were all over the place.
p75
aVWe all saw how hard you were working."
p76
aVAnd so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.
p77
aVAnd I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.
p78
aVHe's coached five Olympians, and
p79
aVthe man's office is lined from floor to ceiling
p80
aVwith All America certificates
p81
aVof all these athletes he's coached.
p82
aVHe's just a rather intimidating figure.
p83
aVAnd I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
V"I want to see if I can, you know \u2014
p88
aVI need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices,
p89
aVsee what drills you do and whatever."
p90
aVThat's all I wanted \u2014 just two practices.
p91
aV"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"
p92
aVAnd he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."
p93
aVYou know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"
p94
aVSo, I met the man, walked in his office,
p95
aVand saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.
p96
aVAnd we got to talking,
p97
aVand it turned out to be a great partnership
p98
aVbecause he'd never coached a disabled athlete,
p99
aVso therefore he had no preconceived notions
p100
aVof what I was or wasn't capable of,
p101
aVand I'd never been coached before.
p102
aVSo this was like, "Here we go \u2014 let's start on this trip."
p103
aa(lp104
VSo he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break,
p105
aVhis free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.
p106
aVSo that's how I met Frank.
p107
aVThat was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,
p108
aVhe said, "You know, you're good enough.
p109
aVYou can run on our women's track team here."
p110
aVAnd I said, "No, come on."
p111
aVAnd he said, "No, no, really. You can.
p112
aVYou can run with our women's track team."
p113
aVIn the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team
p114
aVthat May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.
p115
aVAnd no disabled person had ever done that \u2014 run at a collegiate level.
p116
aVSo I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.
p117
aa(lp118
VSS: Well, on your way to the Olympics,
p119
aVa couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.
p120
aVWhy don't you just tell them?
p121
aVAM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets \u2014
p122
aVeverything I competed in \u2014 and, you know, training in Georgetown
p123
aVand knowing that I was going to have to get used to
p124
aVseeing the backs of all these women's shirts \u2014
p125
aVyou know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo \u2014
p126
aVand they're all looking at me like,
p127
aV"Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"
p128
aVAnd putting on my Georgetown uniform
p129
aVand going out there and knowing that, you know,
p130
aVin order to become better \u2014 and I'm already the best in the country \u2014
p131
aVyou know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd I went out there and made it to the Big East,
p134
aVwhich was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.
p135
aVIt was really, really hot.
p136
aVAnd it's the first \u2014
p137
aVI had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio,
p138
aVand I didn't realize at that time that
p139
aVthe amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock \u2014
p140
aVit actually acted like a lubricant
p141
aVand I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.
p142
aVAnd at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory,
p143
aVI came out of my leg.
p144
aVLike, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
p145
aVAnd I, I mean, was just mortified \u2014
p146
aVbecause I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VI went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this."
p151
aVI can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.
p152
aVAnd if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.
p153
aVAnd he just sat there like this.
p154
aVMy pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.
p155
aVBecause you know, the man is from Brooklyn;
p156
aVhe's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?
p157
aVYou pick it up, you put the damn thing back on,
p158
aVand finish the goddamn race!"
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p161
aVAnd I did. So, he kept me in line.
p162
aVHe kept me on the right track.
p163
aa(lp164
VSS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics,
p165
aVand she's all excited. Her family's coming down \u2014 it's a big deal.
p166
aVIt's now two years that you've been running?
p167
aa(lp168
VAM: No, a year.
p169
aa(lp170
VSS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened
p171
aVright before you go run your race?
p172
aa(lp173
VAM: Okay, well, Atlanta.
p174
aVThe Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,
p175
aVare the Olympics for people with physical disabilities \u2014
p176
aVamputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes \u2014
p177
aVas opposed to the Special Olympics,
p178
aVwhich deals with people with mental disabilities.
p179
aVSo, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,
p180
aVand I'm just blown away by the fact that
p181
aVjust a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.
p182
aVAnd so, here I am \u2014 never lost.
p183
aVI set new records at the U.S. Nationals \u2014 the Olympic trials \u2014 that May,
p184
aVand was sure that I was coming home with the gold.
p185
aVI was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" \u2014 below the knee.
p186
aVI was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
p187
aVI had just done the long jump,
p188
aVand a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,
p189
aV"How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot,
p190
aVso we can't get off on the springboard."
p191
aVI said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, it's funny \u2014 I'm three inches within the world record \u2014
p194
aVand kept on from that point, you know,
p195
aVso I'm signed up in the long jump \u2014 signed up?
p196
aVNo, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
p197
aVAnd I'm sure of it, you know?
p198
aVI made the front page of my hometown paper
p199
aVthat I delivered for six years, you know?
p200
aVIt was, like, this is my time for shine.
p201
aVAnd we're at the trainee warm-up track,
p202
aVwhich is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
p203
aVThese legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now \u2014
p204
aVI was the first person in the world on these legs.
p205
aVI was the guinea pig., I'm telling you,
p206
aVthis was, like \u2014 talk about a tourist attraction.
p207
aa(lp208
VEveryone was taking pictures \u2014 "What is this girl running on?"
p209
aVAnd I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?
p210
aVIt's my first international meet.
p211
aVI tried to get it out of anybody I could,
p212
aVyou know, "Who am I running against here?"
p213
aV"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."
p214
aVI wanted to find out times.
p215
aV"Don't worry, you're doing great."
p216
aVThis is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,
p217
aVand they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.
p218
aVAnd my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
p219
aVThen I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.
p220
aVLane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"
p221
aVAnd they shove us all into the shuttle bus,
p222
aVand all the women there are missing a hand.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VSo, I'm just, like \u2014
p227
aVthey're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?
p228
aVI'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
p229
aVYou know, I'd never lost anything,
p230
aVlike, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know,
p231
aVI'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.
p232
aVAnd Georgetown \u2014 that was great.
p233
aVI was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.
p234
aVHere we are, like, crème de la crème,
p235
aVand there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.
p236
aVAnd, you know, I'm just thinking,
p237
aV"Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van
p238
aVand drove down here from Pennsylvania."
p239
aVAnd, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.
p240
aVSo they call us out and, you know \u2014
p241
aV"Ladies, you have one minute."
p242
aVAnd I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified
p243
aVbecause there was just this murmur coming over the crowd,
p244
aVlike, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.
p245
aVAnd I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."
p246
aVAnd I'm thinking that's my last card to play here;
p247
aVif I'm not going to beat these girls,
p248
aVI'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VI mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany,
p253
aVand everyone else \u2014 Estonia and Poland \u2014 was in this heat.
p254
aVAnd the gun went off, and all I remember was
p255
aVfinishing last and
p256
aVfighting back tears of frustration and incredible \u2014 incredible \u2014
p257
aVthis feeling of just being overwhelmed.
p258
aVAnd I had to think, "Why did I do this?"
p259
aVIf I had won everything \u2014 but it was like, what was the point?
p260
aVAll this training \u2014 I had transformed my life.
p261
aVI became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.
p262
aVAnd it made me really think about how
p263
aVthe achievement was getting there.
p264
aVI mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before,
p265
aVon becoming an Olympic athlete and saying,
p266
aV"Here's my life going in this direction \u2014
p267
aVand I want to take it here for a while,
p268
aVand just seeing how far I could push it."
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd the fact that I asked for help \u2014 how many people jumped on board?
p271
aVHow many people gave of their time and their expertise,
p272
aVand their patience, to deal with me?
p273
aVAnd that was this collective glory \u2014
p274
aVthat there was, you know, 50 people behind me
p275
aVthat had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.
p276
aVSo, I apply this sort of philosophy now
p277
aVto everything I do:
p278
aVsitting back and realizing the progression,
p279
aVhow far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.
p280
aVIt's important to focus on a goal, I think, but
p281
aValso recognize the progression on the way there
p282
aVand how you've grown as a person.
p283
aVThat's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.
p284
aa(lp285
VSS: Why don't you show them your legs?
p286
aa(lp287
VAM: Oh, sure.
p288
aVSS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.
p289
aa(lp290
VAM: Well, these are my pretty legs.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VNo, these are my cosmetic legs, actually,
p295
aVand they're absolutely beautiful.
p296
aVYou've got to come up and see them.
p297
aVThere are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.
p298
aVAnd, seriously, like, I can wear heels.
p299
aVLike, you guys don't understand what that's like
p300
aVto be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.
p301
aVSS: You got to pick your height?
p302
aVAM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VPatrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s,
p307
aVcomes back every summer.
p308
aVAnd I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room
p309
aVbecause he'd come in with foot injuries.
p310
aVI'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.
p311
aVYou can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VHe didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.
p316
aVOK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite,
p317
aVlike I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.
p318
aVNo, I've got so many legs in here.
p319
aVThese are \u2014 do you want to hold that actually?
p320
aVThat's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.
p321
aVIt has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound
p322
aVwhen you jump around on it. All right.
p323
aVAnd then this is the silicon sheath I roll over,
p324
aVto keep it on. Which, when I sweat,
p325
aVyou know, I'm pistoning out of it.
p326
aa(lp327
VSS: Are you a different height?
p328
aa(lp329
VAM: In these?
p330
aa(lp331
VSS: In these.
p332
aa(lp333
VAM: I don't know. I don't think so.
p334
aVI may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.
p335
aa(lp336
VSS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...
p337
aa(lp338
VAM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving,
p339
aVand balance is a little bit of an art in them.
p340
aVBut without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.
p341
aVAnd so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Applause)
p344
aa(lp345
VThese are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.
p346
aVIf you ever watch a sprinter,
p347
aVthe ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.
p348
aVSo when I stand in these legs,
p349
aVmy hamstring and my glutes are contracted,
p350
aVas they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Audience: Who made them?)
p353
aa(lp354
VAM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.
p355
aVAnd I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be
p356
aVin every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
p357
aVBut actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.
p358
aVI need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,
p359
aVit's like a big \u2014 it's come full circle.
p360
aa(lp361
VModerator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2,
p362
aVand we'll talk about the design of them.
p363
aa(lp364
VAM: Yes, we'll do that.
p365
aa(lp366
VSS: Yes, there you go.
p367
aa(lp368
VAM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other...
p369
aa(lp370
VSS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs?
p371
aa(lp372
VAM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England,
p373
aVabout two hours south of London,
p374
aVand I'm the only person in the United States with these,
p375
aVwhich is a crime because they are so beautiful.
p376
aVAnd I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.
p377
aVFor me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track,
p378
aVI want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important
p379
aVnot to be limited in any capacity,
p380
aVwhether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.
p381
aVI mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere
p382
aVand pick out what I want \u2014 the shoes I want, the skirts I want \u2014
p383
aVand I'm hoping to try to bring these over here
p384
aVand make them accessible to a lot of people.
p385
aVThey're also silicon.
p386
aVThis is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.
p387
aVIt's like a Barbie foot under this.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VIt is. It's just stuck in this position,
p392
aVso I have to wear a two-inch heel.
p393
aVAnd, I mean, it's really \u2014 let me take this off so you can see it.
p394
aVI don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.
p395
aVThere're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,
p396
aVand my Achilles' tendon \u2014 that moves a little bit.
p397
aVAnd it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.
p398
aVAnd this is just a silicon piece of skin.
p399
aVI mean, what happened was, two years ago
