VI am a writer.
p5
aVWriting books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
p6
aVIt is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
p7
aVAnd I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
p8
aVBut, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently
p9
aVin my life and in my career,
p10
aVwhich has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
p11
aVAnd the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,
p12
aVthis memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"
p13
aVwhich, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,
p14
aVwent out in the world for some reason, and became this big,
p15
aVmega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
p16
aVThe result of which is that everywhere I go now,
p17
aVpeople treat me like I'm doomed.
p18
aVSeriously \u2014 doomed, doomed!
p19
aVLike, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,
p20
aV"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?
p21
aVAren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life
p22
aVand you're never again going to create a book
p23
aVthat anybody in the world cares about at all,
p24
aVever again?"
p25
aa(lp26
VSo that's reassuring, you know.
p27
aVBut it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember
p28
aVthat over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,
p29
aVwhen I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,
p30
aVI was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.
p31
aVAnd people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?
p32
aVAren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?
p33
aVAren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft
p34
aVand nothing's ever going to come of it
p35
aVand you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams
p36
aVwith your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VLike that, you know.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe answer \u2014 the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."
p43
aVYes, I'm afraid of all those things.
p44
aVAnd I always have been.
p45
aVAnd I'm afraid of many, many more things besides
p46
aVthat people can't even guess at,
p47
aVlike seaweed and other things that are scary.
p48
aVBut, when it comes to writing,
p49
aVthe thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,
p50
aVis why?
p51
aVYou know, is it rational?
p52
aVIs it logical that anybody should be expected
p53
aVto be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
p54
aVAnd what is it specifically about creative ventures
p55
aVthat seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health
p56
aVin a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?
p57
aVLike my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer
p58
aVand I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering
p59
aVanybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
p60
aV"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"
p61
aVIt just didn't come up like that, you know?
p62
aVBut to be fair, chemical engineers as a group
p63
aVhaven't really earned a reputation over the centuries
p64
aVfor being alcoholic manic-depressives.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VWe writers, we kind of do have that reputation,
p69
aVand not just writers, but creative people across all genres,
p70
aVit seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.
p71
aVAnd all you have to do is look at the very grim death count
p72
aVin the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds
p73
aVwho died young and often at their own hands, you know?
p74
aVAnd even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide
p75
aVseem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.
p76
aVNorman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,
p77
aV"Every one of my books has killed me a little more."
p78
aVAn extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
p79
aVBut we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,
p80
aVbecause we've heard that kind of stuff for so long
p81
aVand somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively
p82
aVthis notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked
p83
aVand that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd the question that I want to ask everybody here today
p86
aVis are you guys all cool with that idea?
p87
aVAre you comfortable with that?
p88
aVBecause you look at it even from an inch away and, you know \u2014
p89
aVI'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.
p90
aVI think it's odious.
p91
aVAnd I also think it's dangerous,
p92
aVand I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.
p93
aVI think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd I definitely know that, in my case \u2014 in my situation \u2014
p96
aVit would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path
p97
aVof assumption,
p98
aVparticularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.
p99
aVWhich is \u2014 you know, like check it out,
p100
aVI'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.
p101
aVI still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.
p102
aVAnd it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward
p103
aVis going to be judged by the world as the work that came after
p104
aVthe freakish success of my last book, right?
p105
aVI should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now \u2014
p106
aVit's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
p107
aVSo Jesus, what a thought!
p108
aVThat's the kind of thought that could lead a person
p109
aVto start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,
p110
aVand I don't want to go there.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VI would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd so, the question becomes, how?
p117
aVAnd so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,
p118
aVthat the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,
p119
aVis that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?
p120
aVI have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance
p121
aVbetween me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety
p122
aVabout what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
p123
aVAnd, as I've been looking, over the last year,
p124
aVfor models for how to do that,
p125
aVI've been sort of looking across time,
p126
aVand I've been trying to find other societies
p127
aVto see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have
p128
aVabout how to help creative people
p129
aVsort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
p132
aVSo stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
p133
aVBut, ancient Greece and ancient Rome \u2014
p134
aVpeople did not happen to believe that creativity
p135
aVcame from human beings back then, OK?
p136
aVPeople believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit
p137
aVthat came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,
p138
aVfor distant and unknowable reasons.
p139
aVThe Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."
p140
aVSocrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon
p141
aVwho spoke wisdom to him from afar.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe Romans had the same idea,
p144
aVbut they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
p145
aVWhich is great, because the Romans did not actually think
p146
aVthat a genius was a particularly clever individual.
p147
aVThey believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,
p148
aVwho was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,
p149
aVkind of like Dobby the house elf,
p150
aVand who would come out
p151
aVand sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work
p152
aVand would shape the outcome of that work.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo brilliant \u2014 there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about \u2014
p155
aVthat psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
p156
aVAnd everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
p157
aVSo the ancient artist was protected from certain things,
p158
aVlike, for example, too much narcissism, right?
p159
aVIf your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,
p160
aVeverybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.
p161
aVIf your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
p162
aVEveryone knew your genius was kind of lame.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd this is how people thought about creativity in the West
p167
aVfor a really long time.
p168
aVAnd then the Renaissance came and everything changed,
p169
aVand we had this big idea, and the big idea was,
p170
aVlet's put the individual human being at the center of the universe
p171
aVabove all gods and mysteries,
p172
aVand there's no more room for mystical creatures
p173
aVwho take dictation from the divine.
p174
aVAnd it's the beginning of rational humanism,
p175
aVand people started to believe that creativity
p176
aVcame completely from the self of the individual.
p177
aVAnd for the first time in history,
p178
aVyou start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,
p179
aVrather than having a genius.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
p182
aVYou know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person
p183
aVto believe that he or she is like, the vessel,
p184
aVyou know, like the font and the essence and the source
p185
aVof all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery
p186
aVis just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.
p187
aVIt's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
p188
aVIt just completely warps and distorts egos,
p189
aVand it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.
p190
aVAnd I think the pressure of that
p191
aVhas been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd, if this is true,
p194
aVand I think it is true,
p195
aVthe question becomes, what now?
p196
aVCan we do this differently?
p197
aVMaybe go back to some more ancient understanding
p198
aVabout the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
p199
aVMaybe not.
p200
aVMaybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought
p201
aVin one 18 minute speech.
p202
aVAnd there's probably people in this audience
p203
aVwho would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions
p204
aVabout the notion of, basically, fairies
p205
aVwho follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.
p206
aVI'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
p207
aa(lp208
VBut the question that I kind of want to pose is \u2014
p209
aVyou know, why not?
p210
aVWhy not think about it this way?
p211
aVBecause it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard
p212
aVin terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness
p213
aVof the creative process.
p214
aVA process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something \u2014
p215
aVwhich is to say basically everyone here \u2014-
p216
aVknows does not always behave rationally.
p217
aVAnd, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
p218
aa(lp219
VI had this encounter recently
p220
aVwhere I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone,
p221
aVwho's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life
p222
aVand she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,
p223
aVshe would be out working in the fields,
p224
aVand she said she would feel and hear a poem
p225
aVcoming at her from over the landscape.
p226
aVAnd she said it was like a thunderous train of air.
p227
aVAnd it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.
p228
aVAnd she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.
p229
aVShe knew that she had only one thing to do at that point,
p230
aVand that was to, in her words, "run like hell."
p231
aVAnd she would run like hell to the house
p232
aVand she would be getting chased by this poem,
p233
aVand the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil
p234
aVfast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it
p235
aVand grab it on the page.
p236
aVAnd other times she wouldn't be fast enough,
p237
aVso she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house
p238
aVand the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it
p239
aVand she said it would continue on across the landscape,
p240
aVlooking, as she put it "for another poet."
p241
aVAnd then there were these times \u2014
p242
aVthis is the piece I never forgot \u2014
p243
aVshe said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
p244
aVSo, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper
p245
aVand the poem passes through her,
p246
aVand she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her,
p247
aVand then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand
p248
aVand she would catch it.
p249
aVShe would catch the poem by its tail,
p250
aVand she would pull it backwards into her body
p251
aVas she was transcribing on the page.
p252
aVAnd in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact
p253
aVbut backwards, from the last word to the first.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VSo when I heard that I was like \u2014 that's uncanny,
p258
aVthat's exactly what my creative process is like.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VThat's not at all what my creative process is \u2014 I'm not the pipeline!
p263
aVI'm a mule, and the way that I have to work
p264
aVis I have to get up at the same time every day,
p265
aVand sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.
p266
aVBut even I, in my mulishness,
p267
aVeven I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
p268
aVAnd I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
p269
aVYou know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source
p270
aVthat I honestly cannot identify.
p271
aVAnd what is that thing?
p272
aVAnd how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,
p273
aVbut, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that
p276
aVis the musician Tom Waits,
p277
aVwho I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
p278
aVAnd we were talking about this,
p279
aVand you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment
p280
aVof the tormented contemporary modern artist,
p281
aVtrying to control and manage and dominate
p282
aVthese sort of uncontrollable creative impulses
p283
aVthat were totally internalized.
p284
aa(lp285
VBut then he got older, he got calmer,
p286
aVand one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,
p287
aVand this is when it all changed for him.
p288
aVAnd he's speeding along, and all of a sudden
p289
aVhe hears this little fragment of melody,
p290
aVthat comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,
p291
aVand he wants it, it's gorgeous,
p292
aVand he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.
p293
aVHe doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him
p296
aVlike, "I'm going to lose this thing,
p297
aVand I'll be be haunted by this song forever.
p298
aVI'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
p299
aVAnd instead of panicking, he just stopped.
p300
aVHe just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.
p301
aVHe just looked up at the sky, and he said,
p302
aV"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
V"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?
p307
aVIf you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment
p308
aVwhen I can take care of you.
p309
aVOtherwise, go bother somebody else today.
p310
aVGo bother Leonard Cohen."
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd his whole work process changed after that.
p313
aVNot the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
p314
aVBut the process, and the heavy anxiety around it
p315
aVwas released when he took the genie, the genius out of him
p316
aVwhere it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,
p317
aVand realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.
p318
aVIt could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration,
p319
aVkind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing
p320
aVthat was not quite Tom.
p321
aa(lp322
VWhen I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit
p323
aVthe way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
p324
aVIt saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p325
aVand I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair
p326
aVthat we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming
p327
aVand you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.
p328
aVNot just bad, but the worst book ever written.
p329
aVAnd I started to think I should just dump this project.
p330
aVBut then I remembered Tom talking to the open air
p331
aVand I tried it.
p332
aVSo I just lifted my face up from the manuscript
p333
aVand I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.
p334
aVAnd I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,
p335
aVyou and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant
p336
aVthat is not entirely my fault, right?
p337
aVBecause you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,
p338
aVI don't have any more than this.
p339
aVIf you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.
p340
aVBut if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.
p341
aVI'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.
p342
aVAnd I would please like the record to reflect today
p343
aVthat I showed up for my part of the job."
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VBecause \u2014
p348
aa(lp349
V(Applause)
p350
aa(lp351
VBecause in the end it's like this, OK \u2014
p352
aVcenturies ago in the deserts of North Africa,
p353
aVpeople used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music
p354
aVthat would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
p355
aVThey were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals
p356
aVand they were terrific, right?
p357
aVBut every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen,
p358
aVand one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
p359
aVAnd I know you know what I'm talking about,
p360
aVbecause I know you've all seen, at some point in your life,
p361
aVa performance like this.
p362
aVIt was like time would stop,
p363
aVand the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal
p364
aVand he wasn't doing anything different
p365
aVthan he had ever done, 1,000 nights before,
p366
aVbut everything would align.
p367
aVAnd all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
p368
aVHe would be lit from within, and lit from below
p369
aVand all lit up on fire with divinity.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd when this happened, back then,
p372
aVpeople knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
p373
aVThey would put their hands together and they would start to chant,
p374
aV"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
p375
aVThat's God, you know.
p376
aVCurious historical footnote:
p377
aVwhen the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them
p378
aVand the pronunciation changed over the centuries
p379
aVfrom "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé,"
p380
aVwhich you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
p381
aVIn Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,
p382
aV"Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo,"
p383
aVincomprehensible, there it is \u2014 a glimpse of God.
p384
aVWhich is great, because we need that.
p385
aa(lp386
VBut, the tricky bit comes the next morning,
p387
aVfor the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers
p388
aVthat it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
p389
aVHe's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,
p390
aVand maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
p391
aVAnd maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,
p392
aVand what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
p393
aVThis is hard.
p394
aVThis is one of the most painful reconciliations to make
p395
aVin a creative life.
p396
aVBut maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish
p397
aVif you never happened to believe, in the first place,
p398
aVthat the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
p399
aVBut maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you
p400
aVfrom some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life
p401
aVto be passed along when you're finished,
p402
aVwith somebody else.
p403
aVAnd, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
p404
aa(lp405
VThis is how I've started to think,
p406
aVand this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months
p407
aVas I've been working on the book that will soon be published,
p408
aVas the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up
p409
aVto my freakish success.
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd what I have to sort of keep telling myself
p412
aVwhen I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid.
p413
aVDon't be daunted. Just do your job.
p414
aVContinue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
p415
aVIf your job is to dance, do your dance.
