VJose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,
p10
aVI am overjoyed today
p11
aVat being awarded the TED Prize
p12
aVon behalf of all
p13
aVthe distinguished music teachers,
p14
aVartists and educators from Venezuela
p15
aVwho have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years
p16
aVin founding, growing and developing in Venezuela
p17
aVthe National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.
p18
aa(lp19
VSince I was a boy,
p20
aVin my early childhood,
p21
aVI always wanted to be a musician,
p22
aVand, thank God, I made it.
p23
aVFrom my teachers, my family and my community,
p24
aVI had all the necessary support to become a musician.
p25
aVAll my life I've dreamed
p26
aVthat all Venezuelan children
p27
aVhave the same opportunity that I had.
p28
aVFrom that desire and from my heart
p29
aVstemmed the idea to make music
p30
aVa deep and global reality for my country.
p31
aa(lp32
VFrom the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.
p33
aVBecause the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.
p34
aVI had received a donation of 50 music stands
p35
aVto be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.
p36
aVWhen I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,
p37
aVand I said to myself,
p38
aV"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"
p39
aVI decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,
p40
aVI promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra
p41
aVinto one of the leading orchestras in the world.
p42
aVTwo months ago, I remembered that promise I made,
p43
aVwhen a distinguished English critic
p44
aVpublished an article in the London Times,
p45
aVasking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.
p46
aVHe mentioned four great world orchestras,
p47
aVand the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.
p48
aVToday we can say
p49
aVthat art in Latin America
p50
aVis no longer a monopoly of elites
p51
aVand that it has become a social right,
p52
aVa right for all the people.
p53
aa(lp54
VChild: There is no difference here between classes,
p55
aVnor white or black, nor if you have money or not.
p56
aVSimply, if you are talented,
p57
aVif you have the vocation and the will to be here,
p58
aVyou get in. You share with us and make music.
p59
aa(lp60
VJA: During the recent tour
p61
aVby the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela
p62
aVof U.S. and Europe,
p63
aVwe saw how our music moved young audiences
p64
aVto the bottom of their souls,
p65
aVhow children and adolescents rushed up to the stage
p66
aVto receive the jackets from our musicians,
p67
aVhow the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,
p68
aVseemed to last forever,
p69
aVand how the public, after the concert was over,
p70
aVwent out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.
p71
aVThis meant not only an artistic triumph,
p72
aVbut also a profound emotional sympathy
p73
aVbetween the public of the most advanced nations of the world
p74
aVand the musical youth of Latin America,
p75
aVas seen in Venezuela,
p76
aVgiving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,
p77
aVenthusiasm and strength.
p78
aa(lp79
VIn its essence, the orchestra and the choir
p80
aVare much more than artistic structures.
p81
aVThey are examples and schools of social life,
p82
aVbecause to sing and to play together
p83
aVmeans to intimately coexist
p84
aVtoward perfection and excellence,
p85
aVfollowing a strict discipline of organization and coordination
p86
aVin order to seek the harmonic interdependence
p87
aVof voices and instruments.
p88
aVThat's how they build a spirit of solidarity
p89
aVand fraternity among them,
p90
aVdevelop their self-esteem
p91
aVand foster the ethical and aesthetical values
p92
aVrelated to the music in all its senses.
p93
aVThis is why music is immensely important
p94
aVin the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values
p95
aVand in the training of youngsters
p96
aVto teach other kids.
p97
aa(lp98
VChild: After all this time here,
p99
aVmusic is life.
p100
aVNothing else.
p101
aVMusic is life.
p102
aa(lp103
VJA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,
p104
aVand they are all important and of great significance to me.
p105
aVLet me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.
p106
aVHe is a boy from a parish in Caracas
p107
aVwho passionately attended to his double bass lessons
p108
aVat the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.
p109
aVWith his effort,
p110
aVand the support of his mother, his family and his community,
p111
aVhe became a principal member
p112
aVin the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
p113
aVWe have another well-known case \u2014 Gustavo Dudamel.
p114
aVHe started as a boy member of the children's orchestra
p115
aVin his hometown, Barquisimeto.
p116
aVThere, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.
p117
aVHe became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,
p118
aVand today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.
p119
aVHe is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,
p120
aVand is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.
p121
aVHe was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,
p122
aVand he's an unbeatable example
p123
aVfor young musicians in Latin America and the world.
p124
aa(lp125
VThe structure of El Sistema
p126
aVis based on a new and flexible managing style
p127
aVadapted to the features of each community and region,
p128
aVand today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class
p129
aVall over Venezuela.
p130
aVIt's a program of social rescue
p131
aVand deep cultural transformation
p132
aVdesigned for the whole Venezuelan society
p133
aVwith absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,
p134
aVbut emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:
p137
aVin the personal/social circle,
p138
aVin the family circle and in the community.
p139
aVIn the personal/social circle,
p140
aVthe children in the orchestras and choirs
p141
aVdevelop their intellectual and emotional side.
p142
aVThe music becomes a source
p143
aVfor developing the dimensions of the human being,
p144
aVthus elevating the spirit
p145
aVand leading man to a full development of his personality.
p146
aVSo, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge \u2014
p147
aVthe acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,
p148
aVthe sense of commitment, responsibility,
p149
aVgenerosity and dedication to others,
p150
aVand the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.
p151
aVAll this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.
p152
aa(lp153
VMother Teresa of Calcutta
p154
aVinsisted on something that always impressed me:
p155
aVthe most miserable and tragic thing about poverty
p156
aVis not the lack of bread or roof,
p157
aVbut the feeling of being no-one \u2014
p158
aVthe feeling of not being anyone,
p159
aVthe lack of identification,
p160
aVthe lack of public esteem.
p161
aVThat's why the child's development
p162
aVin the orchestra and the choir
p163
aVprovides him with a noble identity
p164
aVand makes him a role model for his family and community.
p165
aVIt makes him a better student at school
p166
aVbecause it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,
p167
aVperseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.
p168
aa(lp169
VWithin the family, the parents' support is unconditional.
p170
aVThe child becomes a role model for both his parents,
p171
aVand this is very important for a poor child.
p172
aVOnce the child discovers he is important to his family,
p173
aVhe begins to seek new ways of improving himself
p174
aVand hopes better for himself and his community.
p175
aVAlso, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.
p176
aVAll this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.
p177
aVThe large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,
p178
aVto the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.
p179
aVThat encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,
p180
aVand progress in the various opportunities
p181
aVthat music has to offer.
p182
aa(lp183
VFinally, in the circle of the community,
p184
aVthe orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture
p185
aVand sources of exchange and new meanings.
p186
aVThe spontaneity music has
p187
aVexcludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.
p188
aVIt's what makes a child play a violin at home,
p189
aVwhile his father works in his carpentry.
p190
aVIt's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,
p191
aVwhile her mother does the housework.
p192
aVThe idea is that the families join with pride and joy
p193
aVin the activities of the orchestras and the choirs
p194
aVthat their children belong to.
p195
aVThe huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,
p196
aVwhich also lies within itself,
p197
aVends up overcoming material poverty.
p198
aVFrom the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,
p199
aVhe's no longer poor.
p200
aVHe becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,
p201
aVwho'll later become a full citizen.
p202
aVNeedless to say that music is the number one prevention
p203
aVagainst prostitution, violence, bad habits,
p204
aVand everything degrading in the life of a child.
p205
aa(lp206
VA few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee
p207
aVsaid that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.
p208
aVNot an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.
p209
aVI believe that to confront such a crisis,
p210
aVonly art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,
p211
aVto mankind's deepest aspirations,
p212
aVand to the historic demands of our times.
p213
aVEducation \u2014 the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge \u2014
p214
aVis the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,
p215
aVmore noble and more just society.
p216
aa(lp217
VWith passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED
p218
aVfor its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,
p219
aVfor its open and generous promotion of young values.
p220
aVWe hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way
p221
aVto the building of this new era in the teaching of music,
p222
aVin which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims
p223
aVof the child and the adolescent
p224
aVbecome a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.
p225
aVNo longer putting society at the service of art,
p226
aVand much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,
p227
aVbut instead art at the service of society,
p228
aVat the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,
p229
aVat the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,
p230
aVand at the service of all those who cry for vindication
p231
aVthrough the spirit of their human condition
p232
aVand the raising up of their dignity.

p240

p241
aa(lp242
VJA: Here is my TED Prize wish:
p243
aVI wish that you'll help to create and document
p244
aVa special training program
p245
aVfor 50 gifted young musicians,
p246
aVpassionate about their art and social justice,

These talented musicians are a source of national pride<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is a simple concept behind Abreu&#39;s work: for him an orchestra is a place where children learn to listen to each other and to respect one another.
