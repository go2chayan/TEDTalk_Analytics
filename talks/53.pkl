VIf you're here today \u2014
p5
aVand I'm very happy that you are \u2014
p6
aVyou've all heard about how sustainable development
p7
aVwill save us from ourselves.
p8
aVHowever, when we're not at TED, we are often told
p9
aVthat a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible,
p10
aVespecially in large urban areas like New York City.
p11
aVAnd that's because most people with decision-making powers,
p12
aVin both the public and the private sector,
p13
aVreally don't feel as though they're in danger.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog \u2014
p16
aVan abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998.
p17
aVShe turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.
p18
aVWhen she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility
p19
aVplanned for the East River waterfront
p20
aVdespite the fact that our small part of New York City
p21
aValready handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste:
p22
aVa sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,
p23
aVthe world's largest food-distribution center,
p24
aVas well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips
p25
aVto the area each week.
p26
aVThe area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo when I was contacted by the Parks Department
p29
aVabout a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects,
p30
aVI thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.
p31
aVI'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river,
p32
aVbecause of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.
p33
aVThen, while jogging with my dog one morning,
p34
aVshe pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
p35
aVThere were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here,
p36
aVbut she kept dragging me,
p37
aVand lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.
p38
aVI knew that this forgotten little street-end,
p39
aVabandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
p40
aVAnd I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings
p41
aVof the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.
p44
aVWe garnered much support along the way,
p45
aVand the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park
p46
aVthat the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.
p47
aVWe leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times,
p48
aVinto a $3 million park.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Audience whistles)
p53
aa(lp54
VThank you very much.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VThat's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
V(Applause)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut those of us living in environmental justice communities
p65
aVare the canary in the coal mine.
p66
aVWe feel the problems right now, and have for some time.
p67
aVEnvironmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term,
p68
aVgoes something like this:
p69
aVno community should be saddled with more environmental burdens
p70
aVand less environmental benefits than any other.
p71
aa(lp72
VUnfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators
p73
aVas to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees,
p74
aVand where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.
p75
aVAs a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person
p76
aVto live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.
p77
aVI am five times more likely to live within walking distance
p78
aVof a power plant or chemical facility,
p79
aVwhich I do.
p80
aVThese land-use decisions created the hostile conditions
p81
aVthat lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.
p82
aVWhy would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?
p83
aVOur 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country,
p84
aVand diabetes comes with it.
p85
aVOne out of four South Bronx children has asthma.
p86
aVOur asthma hospitalization rate
p87
aVis seven times higher than the national average.
p88
aVThese impacts are coming everyone's way.
p89
aVAnd we all pay dearly for solid waste costs,
p90
aVhealth problems associated with pollution and more odiously,
p91
aVthe cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men,
p92
aVwho possess untold amounts of untapped potential.
p93
aVFifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line;
p94
aV25 percent of us are unemployed.
p95
aVLow-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.
p96
aVThis comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.
p97
aVPoor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.
p98
aa(lp99
VFortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions
p100
aVthat won't compromise the lives
p101
aVof low-income communities of color in the short term,
p102
aVand won't destroy us all in the long term.
p103
aVNone of us want that, and we all have that in common.
p104
aVSo what else do we have in common?
p105
aa(lp106
VWell, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VGraduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees,
p111
aVtraveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens,
p112
aVfinancially stable, never been imprisoned.
p113
aVOK. Good.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VBut, besides being a black woman,
p118
aVI am different from most of you in some other ways.
p119
aVI watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.
p120
aVMy big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,
p121
aVonly to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.
p122
aVJesus.
p123
aVI grew up with a crack house across the street.
p124
aVYeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
p125
aVThese things make me different from you.
p126
aVBut the things we have in common
p127
aVset me apart from most of the people in my community,
p128
aVand I am in between these two worlds
p129
aVwith enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo how did things get so different for us?
p132
aVIn the late '40s, my dad \u2014 a Pullman porter, son of a slave \u2014
p133
aVbought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx,
p134
aVand a few years later, he married my mom.
p135
aVAt the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.
p136
aVMy dad was not alone.
p137
aVAnd as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream,
p138
aVwhite flight became common in the South Bronx
p139
aVand in many cities around the country.
p140
aVRed-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city,
p141
aVincluding ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.
p142
aVMany landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings
p143
aVand collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions \u2014
p144
aVdead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.
p145
aa(lp146
VHunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community,
p147
aVbut now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.
p148
aVA national highway construction boom was added to our problems.
p149
aVIn New York State,
p150
aVRobert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.
p151
aVOne of its primary goals was to make it easier
p152
aVfor residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
p153
aVThe South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.
p154
aVResidents were often given less than a month's notice
p155
aVbefore their buildings were razed.
p156
aV600,000 people were displaced.
p157
aVThe common perception was
p158
aVthat only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
p159
aVAnd if you are told from your earliest days
p160
aVthat nothing good is going to come from your community,
p161
aVthat it's bad and ugly,
p162
aVhow could it not reflect on you?
p163
aVSo now, my family's property was worthless,
p164
aVsave for that it was our home, and all we had.
p165
aVAnd luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it,
p166
aValong with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, why is this story important?
p169
aVBecause from a planning perspective,
p170
aVeconomic degradation begets environmental degradation,
p171
aVwhich begets social degradation.
p172
aVThe disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage
p173
aVfor all the environmental injustices that were to come.
p174
aVAntiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day
p175
aVto continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.
p176
aVAre these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?
p177
aVWhat costs are associated with these decisions?
p178
aVAnd who pays? Who profits?
p179
aVDoes anything justify what the local community goes through?
p180
aVThis was "planning" \u2014 in quotes \u2014
p181
aVthat did not have our best interests in mind.
p182
aa(lp183
VOnce we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.
p184
aVThat small park I told you about earlier
p185
aVwas the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.
p186
aVI wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant
p187
aVto design the plan for a waterfront esplanade
p188
aVwith dedicated on-street bike paths.
p189
aVPhysical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety,
p190
aVthe placement of the waste and other facilities,
p191
aVwhich, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.
p192
aVThey provide opportunities to be more physically active,
p193
aVas well as local economic development.
p194
aVThink bike shops, juice stands.
p195
aVWe secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
p196
aVThis is Lafayette Avenue \u2014
p197
aVand that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
p198
aVAnd once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx
p199
aVwith more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
p200
aVRight now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.
p201
aa(lp202
VAs we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.
p203
aVWe run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training,
p204
aVwhich provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration,
p205
aVso that folks from our community have the skills to compete
p206
aVfor these well-paying jobs.
p207
aVLittle by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs \u2014
p208
aVand with people that have both a financial and personal stake
p209
aVin their environment.
p210
aVThe Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic
p211
aVof the Robert Moses era,
p212
aVbuilt with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.
p213
aVEven during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
p214
aVThe community created an alternative transportation plan
p215
aVthat allows for the removal of the highway.
p216
aVWe have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders
p217
aVto re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized
p218
aVfor parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
p219
aa(lp220
VWe also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project
p221
aVon top of our offices.
p222
aVCool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,
p223
aVand pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
p224
aVGreen roofs are soil and living plants.
p225
aVBoth can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials
p226
aVthat absorb heat, contribute to urban "heat island" effect
p227
aVand degrade under the sun,
p228
aVwhich we in turn breathe.
p229
aVGreen roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall,
p230
aVso they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions \u2014
p231
aVwhich, incidentally, are often located
p232
aVin environmental justice communities like mine.
p233
aVAnd they provide habitats for our little friends!
p234
aa(lp235
V[Butterfly]
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VSo cool!
p240
aa(lp241
VAnyway, the demonstration project is a springboard
p242
aVfor our own green roof installation business,
p243
aVbringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.
p244
aa(lp245
V[Green is the new black ...]
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VI like that, too.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here,
p252
aVbut since I have all of your attention:
p253
aVWe need investors. End of pitch.
p254
aVIt's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
p255
aVAnyway \u2014
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VOK. Katrina.
p262
aa(lp263
VPrior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward
p264
aVhad a lot in common.
p265
aVBoth were largely populated by poor people of color,
p266
aVboth hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.
p267
aVBoth are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents
p268
aVin close proximity of one another.
p269
aVIn the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.
p270
aVWe're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst,
p271
aVby negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning
p272
aVand lax governmental accountability.
p273
aVNeither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
p274
aVBut we have emerged with valuable lessons
p275
aVabout how to dig ourselves out.
p276
aVWe are more than simply national symbols of urban blight
p277
aVor problems to be solved by empty campaign promises
p278
aVof presidents come and gone.
p279
aVNow will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two,
p280
aVlike the South Bronx did?
p281
aVOr will we take proactive steps
p282
aVand learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists
p283
aVthat have been born of desperation in communities like mine?
p284
aa(lp285
VNow listen, I do not expect individuals,
p286
aVcorporations or government to make the world a better place
p287
aVbecause it is right or moral.
p288
aVThis presentation today only represents some of what I've been through.
p289
aVLike a tiny little bit. You've no clue.
p290
aVBut I'll tell you later, if you want to know.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VBut \u2014 I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it,
p295
aVthat motivates people in the end.
p296
aVI'm interested in what I like to call the "triple bottom line"
p297
aVthat sustainable development can produce.
p298
aVDevelopments that have the potential to create positive returns
p299
aVfor all concerned: the developers, government
p300
aVand the community where these projects go up.
p301
aa(lp302
VAt present, that's not happening in New York City.
p303
aVAnd we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit.
p304
aVA parade of government subsidies
p305
aVis going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx,
p306
aVbut there is scant coordination between city agencies
p307
aVon how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution,
p308
aVsolid waste and the impacts on open space.
p309
aVAnd their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame
p310
aVit's not even funny.
p311
aVBecause on top of that,
p312
aVthe world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built
p313
aVby destroying two well-loved community parks.
p314
aVNow, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier.
p315
aVAnd although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars,
p316
aVthese projects include thousands of new parking spaces,
p317
aVyet zip in terms of mass public transit.
p318
aVNow, what's missing from the larger debate
p319
aVis a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis
p320
aVbetween not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community,
p321
aVversus incorporating structural, sustainable changes.
p322
aVMy agency is working closely with Columbia University and others
p323
aVto shine a light on these issues.
p324
aa(lp325
VNow let's get this straight: I am not anti-development.
p326
aVOurs is a city, not a wilderness preserve.
p327
aVAnd I've embraced my inner capitalist.
p328
aVAnd, but I don't have \u2014
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VYou probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VSo I don't have a problem with developers making money.
p337
aVThere's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable,
p338
aVcommunity-friendly development can still make a fortune.
p339
aVFellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins \u2014
p340
aVboth heroes of mine by the way \u2014 have shown that you can actually do that.
p341
aVI do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit
p342
aVpolitically vulnerable communities for profit.
p343
aVThat it continues is a shame upon us all,
p344
aVbecause we are all responsible for the future that we create.
p345
aVBut one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities,
p346
aVis to learn from visionaries in other cities.
p347
aVThis is my version of globalization.
p348
aa(lp349
VLet's take Bogota.
p350
aVPoor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking;
p351
aVa reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx.
p352
aVHowever, this city was blessed in the late 1990s
p353
aVwith a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.
p354
aVHe looked at the demographics.
p355
aVFew Bogotanos own cars,
p356
aVyet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them.
p357
aVIf you're a mayor, you can do something about that.
p358
aVHis administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three,
p359
aVoutlawed parking on those streets,
p360
aVexpanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes,
p361
aVcreated public plazas,
p362
aVcreated one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems
p363
aVin the entire world.
p364
aVFor his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached.
p365
aVBut as people began to see that they were being put first
p366
aVon issues reflecting their day-to-day lives,
p367
aVincredible things happened.
p368
aVPeople stopped littering.
p369
aVCrime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people.
p370
aVHis administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time,
p371
aVand on a third-world budget, at that.
p372
aVWe have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry.
p373
aVBut the bottom line is: their people-first agenda
p374
aVwas not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars,
p375
aVbut rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate
p376
aVin the city's resurgence.
p377
aVThat development should not come
p378
aVat the expense of the majority of the population
p379
aVis still considered a radical idea here in the U.S.
p380
aVBut Bogota's example has the power to change that.
p381
aa(lp382
VYou, however, are blessed with the gift of influence.
p383
aVThat's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange.
p384
aVUse your influence
p385
aVin support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere.
p386
aVDon't just talk about it at TED.
p387
aVThis is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build,
p388
aVand as you all know, politics are personal.
p389
aVHelp me make green the new black.
p390
aVHelp me make sustainability sexy.
p391
aVMake it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations.
p392
aVHelp me fight for environmental and economic justice.
p393
aVSupport investments with a triple-bottom-line return.
p394
aVHelp me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table,
p395
aVand insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.
p396
aVOh good, glad I have a little more time!
p397
aa(lp398
VListen \u2014 when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast,
p399
aVI asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included
p400
aVin his new marketing strategy.
p401
aVHis response was a grant program.
p402
aVI don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding.
p403
aVI was making him an offer.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Applause)
p406
aa(lp407
VWhat troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around.
p408
aVNow, don't get me wrong, we need money.
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VBut grassroots groups are needed at the table
p413
aVduring the decision-making process.
p414
aVOf the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us
p415
aVthat we waste every day,
p416
aVdon't add wasting our energy, intelligence
p417
aVand hard-earned experience to that count.
p418
aa(lp419
V(Applause)
p420
aa(lp421
VI have come from so far to meet you like this.
p422
aVPlease don't waste me.
p423
aVBy working together,
p424
aVwe can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals
p425
aVwho actually have the audacity and courage
p426
aVto believe that we actually can change the world.
p427
aVWe might have come to this conference
p428
aVfrom very, very different stations in life,
p429
aVbut believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing.
p430
aVWe have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
p431
aa(lp432
VCiao, bellos!
