VMost of the time, art and science stare at each other
p5
aVacross a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
p6
aVThere is great confusion when the two look at each other.
p7
aVArt, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,
p8
aVthe emotions \u2014 the unconscious at times \u2014 and of course the aesthetic.
p9
aVScience tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative \u2014
p10
aVthings that can be measured and described \u2014
p11
aVbut it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
p12
aa(lp13
VIn the Extreme Ice Survey,
p14
aVwe're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,
p15
aVto merging the art and science
p16
aVto the end of helping us understand nature
p17
aVand humanity's relationship with nature better.
p18
aVSpecifically, I as a person
p19
aVwho's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,
p20
aVam firmly of the belief that photography, video, film
p21
aVhave tremendous powers for helping us understand
p22
aVand shape the way we think about nature
p23
aVand about ourselves in relationship to nature.
p24
aa(lp25
VIn this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.
p26
aVI'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,
p27
aVthe malleability of it,
p28
aVand the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.
p29
aVThese first images are from Greenland.
p30
aVBut ice has another meaning.
p31
aVIce is the canary in the global coal mine.
p32
aVIt's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.
p33
aa(lp34
VClimate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.
p35
aVWhether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of
p36
aVis it raining more or is it raining less?
p37
aVIs it getting hotter or is it getting colder?
p38
aVWhat do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?
p39
aVAll of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,
p40
aVwhere the ice is, it's real and it's present.
p41
aVThe changes are happening. They're very visible.
p42
aVThey're photographable. They're measurable.
p43
aa(lp44
V95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.
p45
aVThat's outside Antarctica.
p46
aV95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,
p47
aVand that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.
p48
aVThere is no significant scientific dispute about that.
p49
aVIt's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.
p50
aVAnd the great irony and tragedy of our time
p51
aVis that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.
p52
aVScience is not arguing about that.
p53
aVIn these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,
p54
aVice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old
p55
aVbreaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,
p56
aViceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,
p59
aVI was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,
p60
aVbecause I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.
p61
aVI hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements
p62
aVof what the paleoclimates \u2014 the ancient climates \u2014 were,
p63
aVas recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,
p64
aVas recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,
p65
aVand a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,
p68
aVI decided that one day I would do a project
p69
aVlooking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.
p70
aVAnd that led me to this project.
p71
aVInitially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment \u2014
p72
aVconventional, single frame, still photography.
p73
aVAnd one crazy day, I got the idea that I should \u2014
p74
aVafter that assignment was finished \u2014
p75
aVI got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,
p76
aVthat I should station a camera or two at a glacier
p77
aVand let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever
p78
aVand watch the progression of the landscape over time.
p79
aa(lp80
VWell, within about three weeks,
p81
aVI incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras
p82
aVinto 25 time-lapse cameras.
p83
aVAnd the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,
p84
aVtrying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.
p85
aVThey are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.
p86
aVPower goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer
p87
aVthat tells the camera when to fire.
p88
aVAnd these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,
p89
aVand they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,
p90
aVand they watch the evolution of the landscape.
p91
aVWe just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.
p92
aVWe actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,
p93
aVand had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.
p94
aVActually, there's still a camera out there right now.
p95
aVIn any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.
p96
aVSome of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.
p97
aa(lp98
VHere's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVI personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.
p101
aVI spent half my life at our local hardware store
p102
aVduring the months when we built these units originally.
p103
aa(lp104
VWe're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere.
p105
aVOur time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,
p106
aVand we have repeat photography positions,
p107
aVthat is places we just visit on an annual basis,
p108
aVin British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.
p109
aa(lp110
VIt's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight
p111
aVas an ambassador for my whole team.
p112
aVThere's a lot of people working on this right now.
p113
aVWe've got 33 cameras out this moment.
p114
aVWe just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago
p115
aVall across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.
p116
aVAnd we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.
p117
aVWe've been out for two and a half years,
p118
aVand we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.
p119
aa(lp120
VThat's only half our job.
p121
aVThe other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.
p122
aVYou know, scientists have collected this kind of information
p123
aVoff and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.
p124
aVSimilarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,
p125
aVand I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,
p126
aVand like our relationship with the Obama White House,
p127
aVwith the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy
p128
aVas much as possible with these pictures as well.
p129
aVWe've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.
p130
aVWe have a site on Google Earth
p131
aVthat Google Earth was generous enough to give us,
p132
aVand so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,
p133
aVbecause it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.
p136
aVIf everybody in the developed world understood this graph,
p137
aVand emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,
p138
aVthere would be no further societal argument about climate change
p139
aVbecause this is the story that counts.
p140
aVEverything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.
p141
aVKey issues: this is a 400,000 year record.
p142
aVThis exact same pattern is seen going back now
p143
aValmost a million years before our current time.
p144
aVAnd several things are important.
p145
aa(lp146
VNumber one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
p147
aVgo up and down basically in sync.
p148
aVYou can see that from the orange line and the blue line.
p149
aVNature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.
p150
aVThat's the natural cycle.
p151
aVGoes up to 280 and then drops
p152
aVfor various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.
p153
aVBut 280 is the peak.
p154
aVRight now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,
p155
aVwe're at 385 parts per million.
p156
aVWe are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.
p157
aVEarth is having a fever.
p158
aVIn the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth
p159
aVhas gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,
p160
aVand it's going to keep going up
p161
aVbecause we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.
p162
aVAt the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.
p163
aVIt's been a remorseless, steady increase.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe have to turn that around.
p166
aVThat's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that
p167
aVacross Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.
p168
aVBut anyway, off to the world of ice.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.
p171
aVThis is a view of what's called the calving face.
p172
aVThis is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
p173
aVYou see the glacier flowing in from the right,
p174
aVdropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.
p175
aVIf you look in the middle background,
p176
aVyou can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
p177
aVThat means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,
p178
aVand you're about to see the consequences of that floating.
p179
aVTo give you a little bit of a sense of scale,
p180
aVthat calving face in this picture
p181
aVis about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.
p182
aVThis is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
p183
aVThe calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,
p184
aVbut in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.
p185
aVSo there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep
p186
aVgoing down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,
p187
aVand floating if it isn't.
p188
aa(lp189
VHere's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.
p190
aVThis was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
p191
aVThis is an aerial picture we did this year.
p192
aVThat's the retreat of this glacier.
p193
aVThe main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
p194
aVand it's going very rapidly up that stem.
p195
aVWe're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,
p196
aVand we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,
p197
aVbut if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed
p198
aVand it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,
p201
aVbecause as the glaciers \u2014
p202
aVone of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,
p203
aVthey're not normal landscapes \u2014
p204
aVbut as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,
p205
aVlike air is being let out of a balloon.
p206
aVAnd so, there are features on this landscape.
p207
aVThere's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,
p208
aVthat shows you that a little bit.
p209
aVThere's a marker line called the trim line
p210
aVabove our little red illustration there.
p211
aVThis is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do \u2014
p212
aVyou put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? \u2014
p213
aVand yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.
p214
aVBut, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984
p215
aVhas been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.
p216
aa(lp217
VA tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys
p218
aVas it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.
p219
aVThese changes in the alpine world are accelerating.
p220
aVIt's not static.
p221
aVParticularly in the world of sea ice,
p222
aVthe rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,
p223
aVand the processes either are accelerating
p224
aVor the predictions were too low to begin with.
p225
aVBut in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.
p228
aVAnd you see where it ended in these various spring days,
p229
aVJune, May, then October.
p230
aVNow we turn on our time lapse.
p231
aVThis camera was shooting every hour.
p232
aVGeologic process in action here.
p233
aVAnd everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?
p234
aVNo. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.
p235
aVFinally catches up to itself, it advances.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd you can look at these pictures over and over again
p238
aVbecause there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing
p239
aVthese things you don't normally get to see come alive.
p240
aVWe've been talking about "seeing is believing "
p241
aVand seeing the unseen at TED Global.
p242
aVThat's what you see with these cameras.
p243
aVThe images make the invisible visible.
p244
aVThese huge crevasses open up.
p245
aVThese great ice islands break off \u2014
p246
aVand now watch this.
p247
aVThis has been the springtime this year \u2014
p248
aVa huge collapse. That happened in about a month,
p249
aVthe loss of all that ice.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo that's where we started three years ago,
p252
aVway out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the
p253
aVlast time we went into Columbia.
p254
aVTo give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,
p255
aVwe did another cheesy illustration,
p256
aVwith British double-decker buses.
p257
aVIf you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.
p258
aVIt's a long way.
p259
aa(lp260
VOn up to Iceland.
p261
aVOne of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.
p262
aVAnd here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.
p263
aVYou can see this river being formed.
p264
aVYou can see it deflating.
p265
aVWithout the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.
p266
aVYou can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,
p267
aVbut the camera records it.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo we wind time backwards now.
p270
aVWe go back a couple years in time.
p271
aVThat's where it started.
p272
aVThat's where it ended a few months ago.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd on up to Greenland.
p275
aVThe smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.
p276
aVGreenland took a little while to start reacting
p277
aVto the warming climate of the past century,
p278
aVbut it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.
p279
aVAnd there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.
p280
aa(lp281
VIt's a big place. That's all ice.
p282
aVAll those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,
p283
aVjust a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.
p284
aVThe one glacier up in Greenland
p285
aVthat puts more ice into the global ocean
p286
aVthan all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined
p287
aVis the Ilulissat Glacier.
p288
aa(lp289
VWe have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,
p290
aVwatching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.
p291
aVHere's a two-year record of what that looks like.
p292
aVHelicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.
p293
aVThe calving face is four and a half miles across,
p294
aVand in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.
p295
aVSo, imagine how big this is
p296
aVand how much ice is charging out.
p297
aVThe interior of Greenland is to the right.
p298
aVIt's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.
p299
aVIcebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.
p300
aa(lp301
VWe just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,
p302
aVas you can see. June 25th,
p303
aVmonster calving events happened.
p304
aVI'll show you one of those in a second.
p305
aa(lp306
VThis glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.
p307
aVIt now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.
p308
aVIt tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,
p309
aVbut on average, 125 feet a day,
p310
aVtwice the rate it did 20 years ago.
p311
aa(lp312
VOkay. We had a team out watching this glacier,
p313
aVand we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.
p314
aVWe had nine cameras going.
p315
aVThis is what a couple of the cameras saw.
p316
aVA 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.
p317
aVHuge icebergs rolling over.
p318
aVOkay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.
p319
aVSo an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.
p320
aVA mile of retreat in 75 minutes
p321
aVacross the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.
p322
aVThe block was three-fifths of a mile deep,
p323
aVand if you compare the expanse of the calving face
p324
aVto the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.
p325
aVOr if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building
p326
aVand you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,
p327
aVit would be equivalent to how large that block was.
p328
aV75 minutes.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow I've come to the conclusion
p331
aVafter spending a lot of time in this climate change world
p332
aVthat we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.
p333
aVWe have a problem of perception.
p334
aVThe policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,
p335
aVbut we actually can deal with them.
p336
aVI'm certain that we can.
p337
aVBut what we have is a perception problem
p338
aVbecause not enough people really get it yet.
p339
aVYou're an elite audience. You get it.
p340
aVFortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world
p341
aVare an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.
p342
aVBut we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.
p343
aVAnd that's where I think organizations like TED,
p344
aVlike the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact
p345
aVon human perception and bring us along.
p346
aVBecause I believe we have an opportunity right now.
p347
aa(lp348
VWe are nearly on the edge of a crisis,
p349
aVbut we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge
p350
aVof our generation and, in fact, of our century.
p351
aVThis is a terrific, terrific call to arms
p352
aVto do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.
p353
aVI hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature
p354
aVrise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.
