VThese are grim economic times,
p5
aVfellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
p6
aVAnd so, I would like to cheer you up
p7
aVwith one of the great, albeit largely unknown,
p8
aVcommercial success stories
p9
aVof the past 20 years.
p10
aVComparable, in its own very peculiar way,
p11
aVto the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
p12
aVAnd it's an industry which has bucked the current recession
p13
aVwith equanimity.
p14
aVI refer to organized crime.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow organized crime has been around
p17
aVfor a very long time, I hear you say,
p18
aVand these would be wise words, indeed.
p19
aVBut in the last two decades,
p20
aVit has experienced an unprecedented expansion,
p21
aVnow accounting for roughly 15 percent
p22
aVof the world's GDP.
p23
aVI like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,
p24
aVor McMafia, for short.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo what triggered this extraordinary growth
p27
aVin cross-border crime?
p28
aVWell, of course, there is globalization,
p29
aVtechnology, communications, all that stuff,
p30
aVwhich we'll talk about a little bit later.
p31
aVBut first, I would like to take you back
p32
aVto this event:
p33
aVthe collapse of communism.
p34
aVAll across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode
p35
aVin our post-war history.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow it's time for full disclosure.
p38
aVThis event meant a great deal to me personally.
p39
aVI had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain
p40
aVto Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,
p41
aVlike Solidarity in Poland,
p42
aVwhen I was in my teens.
p43
aVI then started writing about Eastern Europe,
p44
aVand eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,
p45
aVwhich is what I was doing in 1989.
p46
aVAnd so when 425 million people
p47
aVfinally won the right
p48
aVto choose their own governments,
p49
aVI was ecstatic,
p50
aVbut I was also a touch worried
p51
aVabout some of the nastier things
p52
aVlurking behind the wall.
p53
aa(lp54
VIt wasn't long, for example,
p55
aVbefore ethnic nationalism
p56
aVreared its bloody head
p57
aVin Yugoslavia.
p58
aVAnd amongst the chaos,
p59
aVamidst the euphoria,
p60
aVit took me a little while to understand
p61
aVthat some of the people who had wielded power
p62
aVbefore 1989, in Eastern Europe,
p63
aVcontinued to do so after the revolutions there.
p64
aVObviously there were characters like this.
p65
aVBut there were also some more unexpected people
p66
aVwho played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.
p67
aa(lp68
VLike this character. Remember these guys?
p69
aVThey used to win the gold medals in weightlifting
p70
aVand wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,
p71
aVand they were the great celebrities of communism,
p72
aVwith a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
p73
aVThey used to get great apartments in the center of town,
p74
aVcasual sex on tap,
p75
aVand they could travel to the West very freely,
p76
aVwhich was a great luxury at the time.
p77
aVIt may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role
p78
aVin the emergence of the market economy
p79
aVin Eastern Europe.
p80
aVOr as I like to call them, they are
p81
aVthe midwives of capitalism.
p82
aVHere are some of those same weightlifters
p83
aVafter their 1989 makeover.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow in Bulgaria \u2014
p86
aVthis photograph was taken in Bulgaria \u2014
p87
aVwhen communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,
p88
aVit wasn't just communism;
p89
aVit was the state that collapsed as well.
p90
aVThat means your police force wasn't working.
p91
aVThe court system wasn't functioning properly.
p92
aVSo what was a business man in the brave new world
p93
aVof East European capitalism going to do
p94
aVto make sure that his contracts would be honored?
p95
aVWell, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically
p96
aVby sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
p97
aVWe prefer to know them as the mafia.
p98
aVAnd in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined
p99
aVwith 14,000 people
p100
aVwho were sacked from their jobs in the security services
p101
aVbetween 1989 and 1991.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, when your state is collapsing,
p104
aVyour economy is heading south at a rate of knots,
p105
aVthe last people you want coming on to the labor market
p106
aVare 14,000 men and women whose chief skills
p107
aVare surveillance,
p108
aVare smuggling, building underground networks
p109
aVand killing people.
p110
aVBut that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.
p111
aVNow, when I was working in the 1990s,
p112
aVI spent most of the time covering
p113
aVthe appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd I couldn't help notice
p116
aVthat the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,
p117
aVthe paramilitary organizations,
p118
aVwere actually the same people running
p119
aVthe organized criminal syndicates.
p120
aVAnd I came to think that behind the violence
p121
aVlay a sinister criminal enterprise.
p122
aVAnd so I resolved to travel around the world
p123
aVexamining this global criminal underworld
p124
aVby talking to policemen,
p125
aVby talking to victims, by talking to consumers
p126
aVof illicit goods and services.
p127
aVBut above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.
p130
aVWhy? Well of course
p131
aVthere was the issue of law and order collapsing,
p132
aVbut also, as they say in the retail trade,
p133
aVit's location, location, location.
p134
aVAnd what I noticed at the beginning of my research
p135
aVthat the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone
p136
aVfor illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
p137
aVHeroin, cocaine,
p138
aVwomen being trafficked into prostitution
p139
aVand precious minerals.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd where were they heading?
p142
aVThe European Union, which by now
p143
aVwas beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,
p144
aVtransforming it into
p145
aVthe most affluent consumer market in history,
p146
aVeventually comprising some 500 million people.
p147
aVAnd a significant minority
p148
aVof those 500 million people
p149
aVlike to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash
p150
aVsleeping with prostitutes,
p151
aVsticking 50 Euro notes up their nose
p152
aVand employing illegal migrant laborers.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, organized crime in a globalizing world
p155
aVoperates in the same way as any other business.
p156
aVIt has zones of production,
p157
aVlike Afghanistan and Columbia.
p158
aVIt has zones of distribution,
p159
aVlike Mexico and the Balkans.
p160
aVAnd then, of course, it has zones of consumption,
p161
aVlike the European Union, Japan
p162
aVand of course, the United States.
p163
aVThe zones of production and distribution
p164
aVtend to lie in the developing world,
p165
aVand they are often threatened by appalling violence
p166
aVand bloodshed.
p167
aa(lp168
VTake Mexico, for example.
p169
aVSix thousand people killed there in the last 18 months
p170
aVas a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
p171
aVBut what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?
p172
aVSince 1998, five million people have died there.
p173
aVIt's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,
p174
aVbut it's the biggest conflict on this planet
p175
aVsince the Second World War.
p176
aVAnd why is it? Because mafias from all around the world
p177
aVcooperate with local paramilitaries
p178
aVin order to seize the supplies
p179
aVof the rich mineral resources
p180
aVof the region.
p181
aa(lp182
VIn the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan
p183
aVwas sourced to the killing fields
p184
aVof the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
p185
aVNow, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,
p186
aVin almost every laptop
p187
aVand games console.
p188
aVThe Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia
p189
aVin exchange for weapons,
p190
aVand the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
p191
aVAnd it is this Western desire
p192
aVto consume
p193
aVthat is the primary driver
p194
aVof international organized crime.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, let me show you some of my friends in action,
p197
aVcaught conveniently on film by the Italian police,
p198
aVand smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
p199
aVNow, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.
p200
aVThe European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
p201
aVSo if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,
p202
aVthere are very handsome profits to be made,
p203
aVand I want to show you this to demonstrate
p204
aVthe type of resources available to these groups.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
p207
aVAnd it's the fastest thing on European waters.
p208
aVFrom 1994, for seven years,
p209
aV20 of these boats
p210
aVmade the trip across the Adriatic,
p211
aVfrom Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
p212
aVAnd as a consequence of this trade,
p213
aVBritain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
p214
aVAnd instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia
p215
aVand line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow Italian police, when this trade started,
p218
aVhad just two boats which could go at the same speed.
p219
aVAnd this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys
p220
aVis if they run out of gas.
p221
aVSometimes the gangsters would bring with them
p222
aVwomen being trafficked into prostitution,
p223
aVand if the police intervened, they would hurl
p224
aVthe women into the sea
p225
aVso that the police had to go and save them from drowning,
p226
aVrather than chasing the bad guys.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo I have shown you this to demonstrate
p229
aVhow many boats, how many vessels it takes
p230
aVto catch one of these guys.
p231
aVAnd the answer is six vessels.
p232
aVAnd remember, 20 of these speed boats
p233
aVwere coming across the Adriatic
p234
aVevery single night.
p235
aVSo what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
p236
aa(lp237
VWell, this is where we come to globalization,
p238
aVbecause that was not just the deregulation of global trade.
p239
aVIt was the liberalization of international financial markets.
p240
aVAnd boy, did that make it easy
p241
aVfor the money launderers.
p242
aVThe last two decades have been the champagne era
p243
aVfor dirty lucre.
p244
aa(lp245
VIn the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world
p246
aVcompeting for their business,
p247
aVand there was simply no effective mechanism
p248
aVto prevent money laundering.
p249
aVAnd a lot of licit banks were also happy
p250
aVto accept deposits
p251
aVfrom very dubious sources
p252
aVwithout questions being asked.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.
p255
aVNow these things
p256
aVare an essential part of the money laundering parade,
p257
aVand if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion
p258
aVand transnational organized crime, money laundering,
p259
aVyou have to get rid of them.
p260
aVOn a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House
p261
aVwho has consistently spoken out
p262
aVagainst these corrosive entities.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd if anyone is concerned about what I believe
p265
aVis the necessity for
p266
aVnew legislation, regulation, effective regulation,
p267
aVI say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,
p268
aVwho is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.
p269
aVBernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.
p270
aVThat puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters
p271
aVwith the Colombian cartels
p272
aVand the major Russian crime syndicates,
p273
aVbut he did this for decades
p274
aVin the very heart of Wall Street,
p275
aVand no regulator picked up on it.
p276
aVSo how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street
p277
aVor in the city of London,
p278
aVfleecing ordinary folk
p279
aVand money laundering?
p280
aVWell I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.
p281
aa(lp282
VLet me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.
p283
aVAnd that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
p284
aVThis one, however, is in central British Columbia
p285
aVwhere I photographed it.
p286
aVIt's one of the tens of thousands
p287
aVof mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
p288
aVwhich ensure that over five percent
p289
aVof the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera,
p292
aVof the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
p293
aVto a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver
p294
aVto see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated
p295
aVby the RCMP
p296
aVfrom the smugglers who are sending it,
p297
aVof course, down south to the United States
p298
aVwhere there is an insatiable market
p299
aVfor B.C. Bud, as it's called,
p300
aVin part because it's marketed as organic,
p301
aVwhich of course goes down very well in California.
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aV(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VNow, even by the police's admission,
p306
aVthis makes not a dent in the profits, really,
p307
aVof the major exporters.
p308
aVSince the beginning of globalization,
p309
aVthe global narcotics market has expanded enormously.
p310
aVThere has, however, been no concomitant increase
p311
aVin the resources available
p312
aVto police forces.
p313
aa(lp314
VThis, however, may all be about to change,
p315
aVbecause something very strange is going on.
p316
aVThe United Nations recognized
p317
aVearlier this \u2014 it was last month actually \u2014
p318
aVthat Canada has become a key area of distribution and production
p319
aVof ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
p320
aa(lp321
VInterestingly, the market share
p322
aVof heroin and cocaine is going down,
p323
aVbecause the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.
p324
aVNow that is a game changer,
p325
aVbecause it shifts production away from the developing world
p326
aVand into the Western world.
p327
aVWhen that happens, it is a trend
p328
aVwhich is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
p329
aVThe drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years
p330
aVis long overdue for a very serious rethink,
p331
aVin my opinion.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow, the recession.
p334
aVWell, organized crime has already adapted
p335
aVvery well to the recession.
p336
aVNot surprising, the most opportunistic industry
p337
aVin the whole world.
p338
aVAnd it has no rules to its regulatory system.
p339
aVExcept, of course, it has two business risks:
p340
aVarrest by law enforcement,
p341
aVwhich is, frankly, the least of their worries,
p342
aVand competition from other groups,
p343
aVi.e. a bullet in the back of the head.
p344
aa(lp345
VWhat they've done is they've shifted their operations.
p346
aVPeople don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently
p347
aVduring a recession.
p348
aVAnd so instead, they have invaded financial
p349
aVand corporate crime in a big way,
p350
aVbut above all, two sectors,
p351
aVand that is counterfeit goods
p352
aVand cybercrime.
p353
aVAnd it's been terribly successful.
p354
aVI would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.
p355
aVOr perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.
p356
aa(lp357
VI was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.
p358
aVWe sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista
p359
aVin São Paulo, together.
p360
aVHooked it up to my laptop,
p361
aVand within about five minutes he had penetrated
p362
aVthe computer security system
p363
aVof a major Brazilian bank.
p364
aVIt's really not that difficult.
p365
aVAnd it's actually much easier because
p366
aVthe fascinating thing about cybercrime
p367
aVis that it's not so much the technology.
p368
aa(lp369
VThe key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.
p370
aVOr to use the technical term for it,
p371
aVthere's one born every minute.
p372
aVYou would not believe how easy it is
p373
aVto persuade people to do things with their computers
p374
aVwhich are objectively not in their interest.
p375
aVAnd it was very soon
p376
aVwhen the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,
p377
aVof course, the quickest way to a person's wallet
p378
aVis through the promise of sex and love.
p379
aa(lp380
VI expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus,
p381
aVone of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
p382
aVI was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,
p383
aVbecause the first person I received it from
p384
aVwas an ex-girlfriend of mine.
p385
aVNow, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,
p386
aVbut love was not amongst them.
p387
aV(Laughter)
p388
aVAnd so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,
p389
aVI dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin
p390
aVand spared myself a very nasty infection.
p391
aa(lp392
VSo, cybercrime, do watch out for it.
p393
aVOne thing that we do know that the Internet is doing
p394
aVis the Internet is assisting these guys.
p395
aVThese are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite
p396
aVwhich infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal
p397
aVat our expense.
p398
aa(lp399
VNow, Artesunate is a very effective drug
p400
aVat destroying the parasite in the early days
p401
aVof infection.
p402
aVBut over the past year or so,
p403
aVresearchers in Cambodia have discovered
p404
aVthat what's happening is
p405
aVthe malarial parasite is developing a resistance.
p406
aVAnd they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance
p407
aVis because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,
p408
aVand so they buy it from the Internet.
p409
aVAnd these pills contain only low doses
p410
aVof the active ingredient.
p411
aVWhich is why
p412
aVthe parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.
p413
aa(lp414
VThe reason I say this
p415
aVis because we have to know
p416
aVthat organized crime
p417
aVimpacts all sorts of areas of our lives.
p418
aVYou don't have to sleep with prostitutes
p419
aVor take drugs
p420
aVin order to have a relationship with organized crime.
p421
aVThey affect our bank accounts.
p422
aVThey affect our communications, our pension funds.
p423
aVThey even affect the food that we eat
p424
aVand our governments.
p425
aa(lp426
VThis is no longer an issue
p427
aVof Sicilians from Palermo and New York.
p428
aVThere is no romance involved with gangsters
p429
aVin the 21st Century.
p430
aVThis is a mighty industry,
p431
aVand it creates instability and violence
p432
aVwherever it goes.
p433
aVIt is a major economic force
p434
aVand we need to take it very, very seriously.
p435
aVIt's been a privilege talking to you.
p436
aVThank you very much.
