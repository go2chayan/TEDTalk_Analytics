VI bet you're worried.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI was worried.
p9
aVThat's why I began this piece.
p10
aVI was worried about vaginas.
p11
aVI was worried what we think about vaginas
p12
aVand even more worried that we don't think about them.
p13
aVI was worried about my own vagina.
p14
aVIt needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.
p15
aVThere is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them.
p16
aVLike the Bermuda Triangle, nobody ever reports back from there.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VIn the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.
p21
aVWomen go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.
p22
aVI interviewed a high-powered businesswoman;
p23
aVshe told me she didn't have time.
p24
aV"Looking at your vagina," she said, "is a full day's work."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
V"You've got to get down there on your back, in front of a mirror,
p29
aVfull-length preferred.
p30
aVYou've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light,
p31
aVwhich then becomes shadowed by the angle you're at.
p32
aVYou're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting."
p33
aVShe was busy; she didn't have time.
p34
aVSo I decided to talk to women about their vaginas.
p35
aVThey began as casual vagina interviews,
p36
aVand they turned into vagina monologues.
p37
aVI talked with over 200 women.
p38
aVI talked to older women, younger women,
p39
aVmarried women, lesbians, single women.
p40
aVI talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers.
p41
aVI talked to African-American women, Asian-American women,
p42
aVNative-American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women.
p43
aa(lp44
VOK, at first women were a little shy, a little reluctant to talk.
p45
aVOnce they got going, you couldn't stop them.
p46
aVWomen love to talk about their vaginas, they do.
p47
aVMainly because no one's ever asked them before.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VLet's just start with the word "vagina" \u2014 vagina, vagina.
p52
aVIt sounds like an infection, at best.
p53
aVMaybe a medical instrument.
p54
aV"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VVagina, vagina, vagina.
p59
aa(lp60
VIt doesn't matter how many times you say the word,
p61
aVit never sounds like a word you want to say.
p62
aVIt's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.
p63
aVIf you use it during sex, trying to be politically correct,
p64
aV"Darling, would you stroke my vagina,"
p65
aVyou kill the act right there.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VI'm worried what we call them and don't call them.
p70
aVIn Great Neck, New York, they call it a Pussycat.
p71
aVA woman told me there her mother used to tell her,
p72
aV"Don't wear panties, dear, underneath your pajamas.
p73
aVYou need to air out your Pussycat."
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VIn Westchester, they call it a Pooki,
p78
aVin New Jersey, a twat.
p79
aVThere's Powderbox, derriere, a Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,
p80
aVa Poopelu, a Pooninana, a Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VThere's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi, Dignity, Coochi Snorcher,
p85
aVCooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,
p86
aVWee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,
p87
aVMongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox, a Mimi in Miami,
p88
aVa Split Knish in Philadelphia ...
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
Vand a Schmende in the Bronx.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VI am worried about vaginas.
p97
aVThis is how the "Vagina Monologues" begins.
p98
aVBut it really didn't begin there.
p99
aVIt began with a conversation with a woman.
p100
aVWe were having a conversation about menopause,
p101
aVand we got onto the subject of her vagina,
p102
aVwhich you'll do if you're talking about menopause.
p103
aVAnd she said things that really shocked me about her vagina \u2014
p104
aVthat it was dried-up and finished and dead \u2014
p105
aVand I was kind of shocked.
p106
aVSo I said to a friend casually,
p107
aV"Well, what do you think about your vagina?"
p108
aVAnd that woman said something more amazing,
p109
aVand then the next woman said something more amazing,
p110
aVand before I knew it, every woman was telling me
p111
aVI had to talk to somebody about their vagina
p112
aVbecause they had an amazing story,
p113
aVand I was sucked down the vagina trail.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd I really haven't gotten off of it.
p118
aVI think if you had told me when I was younger
p119
aVthat I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores,
p120
aVand people would scream out, "There she is, the Vagina Lady!"
p121
aVI don't know that that would have been my life ambition.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VBut I want to talk a little bit about happiness,
p126
aVand the relationship to this whole vagina journey,
p127
aVbecause it has been an extraordinary journey
p128
aVthat began eight years ago.
p129
aVI think before I did the "Vagina Monologues,"
p130
aVI didn't really believe in happiness.
p131
aVI thought that only idiots were happy, to be honest.
p132
aVI remember when I started practicing Buddhism 14 years ago,
p133
aVand I was told that the end of this practice was to be happy,
p134
aVI said, "How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering
p135
aVand live in this world of pain?"
p136
aVI mistook happiness for a lot of other things,
p137
aVlike numbness or decadence or selfishness.
p138
aVAnd what happened through the course of the "Vagina Monologues"
p139
aVand this journey is, I think I have come to understand
p140
aVa little bit more about happiness.
p141
aa(lp142
VThere are three qualities I want to talk about.
p143
aVOne is seeing what's right in front of you,
p144
aVand talking about it, and stating it.
p145
aVI think what I learned from talking about the vagina
p146
aVand speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing \u2014
p147
aVit was right in the center of my body and the center of the world \u2014
p148
aVand yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.
p149
aVThe second thing is that what talking about the vagina did
p150
aVis it opened this door which allowed me to see
p151
aVthat there was a way to serve the world to make it better.
p152
aVAnd that's where the deepest happiness has actually come from.
p153
aVAnd the third principle of happiness, which I've realized recently:
p154
aa(lp155
VEight years ago, this momentum and this energy, this "V-wave" started \u2014
p156
aVand I can only describe it as a "V-wave" because, to be honest,
p157
aVI really don't understand it completely; I feel at the service of it.
p158
aVBut this wave started, and if I question the wave,
p159
aVor try to stop the wave or look back at the wave,
p160
aVI often have the experience of whiplash
p161
aVor the potential of my neck breaking.
p162
aVBut if I go with the wave,
p163
aVand I trust the wave and I move with the wave,
p164
aVI go to the next place, and it happens logically and organically and truthfully.
p165
aVAnd I started this piece, particularly with stories and narratives,
p166
aVand I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman
p167
aVand that led to another woman.
p168
aVAnd then I wrote those stories down,
p169
aVand I put them out in front of other people.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd every single time I did the show at the beginning,
p172
aVwomen would literally line up after the show,
p173
aVbecause they wanted to tell me their stories.
p174
aVAnd at first I thought, "Oh great, I'll hear about wonderful orgasms,
p175
aVand great sex lives, and how women love their vaginas."
p176
aVBut in fact, that's not what women lined up to tell me.
p177
aVWhat women lined up to tell me was how they were raped,
p178
aVand how they were battered, and how they were beaten,
p179
aVand how they were gang-raped in parking lots,
p180
aVand how they were incested by their uncles.
p181
aVAnd I wanted to stop doing the "Vagina Monologues,"
p182
aVbecause it felt too daunting.
p183
aVI felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events,
p184
aVbut doesn't intervene on their behalf.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd so in 1997, I said, "Let's get women together.
p187
aVWhat could we do with this information
p188
aVthat all these women are being violated?"
p189
aVAnd it turned out, after thinking and investigating,
p190
aVthat I discovered \u2014 and the UN has actually said this recently \u2014
p191
aVthat one out of every three women on this planet
p192
aVwill be beaten or raped in her lifetime.
p193
aVThat's essentially a gender;
p194
aVthat's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women.
p195
aVSo in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said,
p196
aV"How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?"
p197
aVAnd we put on one event in New York City, in the theater,
p198
aVand all these great actors came \u2014 from Susan Sarandon,
p199
aVto Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg \u2014
p200
aVand we did one performance on one evening,
p201
aVand that catalyzed this wave, this energy.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd within five years,
p204
aVthis extraordinary thing began to happen.
p205
aVOne woman took that energy and she said, "I want to bring this wave,
p206
aVthis energy, to college campuses,"
p207
aVand so she took the play and she said,
p208
aV"Let's use the play and have performances once a year,
p209
aVwhere we can raise money to stop violence against women
p210
aVin local communities all around the world."
p211
aVAnd in one year, it went to 50 colleges, and then it expanded.
p212
aVAnd over the course of the last six years,
p213
aVit's spread and it's spread and it's spread around the world.
p214
aa(lp215
VWhat I have learned is two things:
p216
aVone, that the epidemic of violence towards women is shocking; it's global;
p217
aVit is so profound and it is so devastating,
p218
aVand it is so in every little pocket of every little crater,
p219
aVof every little society that we don't even recognize it,
p220
aVbecause it's become ordinary.
p221
aVThis journey has taken me to Afghanistan,
p222
aVwhere I had the extraordinary honor and privilege
p223
aVto go into parts of Afghanistan under the Taliban.
p224
aVI was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group,
p225
aVcalled the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.
p226
aVAnd I saw firsthand how women had been stripped
p227
aVof every single right that was possible to strip women of \u2014
p228
aVfrom being educated, to being employed,
p229
aVto being actually allowed to eat ice cream.
p230
aVFor those of you who don't know,
p231
aVit was illegal to eat ice cream under the Taliban.
p232
aVAnd I actually saw and met women who had been flogged
p233
aVfor being caught eating vanilla ice cream.
p234
aVI was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town,
p235
aVwhere we went to a back room, and women were seated
p236
aVand a curtain was pulled around us, and they were served vanilla ice cream.
p237
aVAnd women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream.
p238
aVAnd I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment,
p239
aVand how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.
p240
aa(lp241
VIt has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad,
p242
aVwhere I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.
p243
aVIt has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago,
p244
aVwhere I have literally been there in parking lots,
p245
aVwhere bones of women have washed up
p246
aVand been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.
p247
aVIt has taken me to universities all over this country,
p248
aVwhere girls are date-raped and drugged.
p249
aVI have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence.
p250
aVBut I have also recognized, in the course of seeing that violence,
p251
aVthat being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us
p252
aVis the antidote to depression,
p253
aVand to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value.
p254
aa(lp255
VBecause before the "Vagina Monologues,"
p256
aVI will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off
p257
aVto what was really going on in this reality,
p258
aVand that closing-off closed off my vitality and my life energy.
p259
aVWhat has also happened is in the course of these travels \u2014
p260
aVand it's been an extraordinary thing \u2014
p261
aVis that every single place that I have gone to in the world,
p262
aVI have met a new species.
p263
aVAnd I really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea.
p264
aVAnd I was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people
p265
aVon this particular panel,
p266
aVthat it's beneath, beyond and between,
p267
aVand the vagina kind of fits into all those categories.
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VBut one of the things I've seen is this species \u2014
p272
aVand it is a species, and it is a new paradigm,
p273
aVand it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media
p274
aVbecause I don't think good news ever is news,
p275
aVand I don't think people who are transforming the planet
p276
aVare what gets the ratings on TV shows.
p277
aVBut every single country I have been to \u2014
p278
aVand in the last six years, I've been to about 45 countries,
p279
aVand many tiny little villages and cities and towns \u2014
p280
aVI have seen something what I've come to call "vagina warriors."
p281
aVA "vagina warrior" is a woman, or a vagina-friendly man,
p282
aVwho has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it,
p283
aVand rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction
p284
aVor a machete,
p285
aVthey hold the violence in their bodies;
p286
aVthey grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out
p287
aVand devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.
p288
aa(lp289
VI have met these women everywhere on the planet,
p290
aVand I want to tell a few stories,
p291
aVbecause I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information,
p292
aVwhere it goes into our bodies.
p293
aVAnd I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting
p294
aVis that I live in my body a lot,
p295
aVand I don't live in my head very much anymore.
p296
aVAnd this is a very heady place.
p297
aVAnd it's been really interesting to be in my head
p298
aVfor the last two days; I've been very disoriented \u2014
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
Vbecause I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body.
p303
aVIt's a body world, and the species really exists in the body.
p304
aVAnd I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads,
p305
aVthat that separation has created a divide
p306
aVthat is often separating purpose from intent.
p307
aVAnd the connection between body and head
p308
aVoften brings those things into union.
p309
aa(lp310
VI want to talk about three particular people that I've met,
p311
aVvagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding
p312
aVof this whole principle and species,
p313
aVand one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.
p314
aVMarsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala.
p315
aVShe was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage
p316
aVand her husband was beating her on a regular basis.
p317
aVAnd she couldn't get out,
p318
aVbecause she was addicted to the relationship,
p319
aVand she had no money.
p320
aVHer sister was younger than her, and she applied \u2014
p321
aVwe had a "Stop Rape" contest a few years ago in New York \u2014
p322
aVand she applied, hoping that she would become a finalist
p323
aVand she could bring her sister.
p324
aVShe did become a finalist; she brought Marsha to New York.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd at that time,
p327
aVwe did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden,
p328
aVwhere we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome \u2014
p329
aV18,000 people standing up to say "Yes" to vaginas,
p330
aVwhich was really a pretty incredible transformation.
p331
aVAnd she came, and she witnessed this,
p332
aVand she decided that she would go back and leave her husband,
p333
aVand that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala.
p334
aVShe was 21 years old.
p335
aVI went to Guatemala and she had sold out the National Theater of Guatemala.
p336
aVAnd I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels,
p337
aVand she stood there and said, "My name is Marsha.
p338
aVI was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me.
p339
aVI left and you can, too."
p340
aVAnd the entire 2,000 people went absolutely crazy.
p341
aa(lp342
VThere's a woman named Esther Chávez who I met in Juarez, Mexico.
p343
aVAnd Esther Chávez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City.
p344
aVShe was 72 years old and she was planning to retire.
p345
aVShe went to Juarez to take care of an ailing aunt,
p346
aVand in the course of it, she began to discover what was happening
p347
aVto the murdered and disappeared women of Juarez.
p348
aVShe gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.
p349
aVShe started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.
p350
aV300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor.
p351
aVThere has been no response to the disappearance,
p352
aVand not one person has been held accountable.
p353
aVShe began to document it.
p354
aVShe opened a center called Casa Amiga, and in six years,
p355
aVshe has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world.
p356
aVWe were there a week ago,
p357
aVwhen there were 7,000 people in the street, and it was truly a miracle.
p358
aVAnd as we walked through the streets,
p359
aVthe people of Juarez, who normally don't even come into the streets,
p360
aVbecause the streets are so dangerous,
p361
aVliterally stood there and wept,
p362
aVto see that other people from the world had showed up
p363
aVfor that particular community.
p364
aa(lp365
VThere's another woman, named Agnes.
p366
aVAnd Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.
p367
aVI met her three years ago in Kenya.
p368
aVAnd Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;
p369
aVshe was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old,
p370
aVand she really made a decision
p371
aVthat she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community.
p372
aVSo when she got older, she created this incredible thing:
p373
aVit's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body, half a woman's body.
p374
aVAnd she walked through the Rift Valley,
p375
aVand she had vagina and vagina replacement parts,
p376
aVwhere she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls
p377
aVwhat a healthy vagina looks like, and what a mutilated vagina looks like.
p378
aa(lp379
VAnd in the course of her travel \u2014
p380
aVshe walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley,
p381
aVthrough dust, through sleeping on the ground,
p382
aVbecause the Maasai are nomads,
p383
aVand she would have to find them, and they would move,
p384
aVand she would find them again \u2014
p385
aVshe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
p386
aa(lp387
VAnd in that time, she created an alternative ritual,
p388
aVwhich involved girls coming of age without the cut.
p389
aVWhen we met her three years ago,
p390
aVwe said, "What could V-Day do for you?"
p391
aVAnd she said, "Well, if you got me a jeep, I could get around a lot faster."
p392
aa(lp393
V(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VSo we bought her a jeep.
p396
aVAnd in the year that she had the jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
p397
aVSo we said to her, "What else could we do for you?"
p398
aVShe said, "Well, Eve, if you gave me some money,
p399
aVI could open a house and girls could run away,
p400
aVand they could be saved."
p401
aVAnd I want to tell this little story about my own beginnings,
p402
aVbecause it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.
p403
aa(lp404
VWhen I was a little girl \u2014 I grew up in a wealthy community;
p405
aVit was an upper-middle class white community,
p406
aVand it had all the trappings and the looks
p407
aVof a perfectly nice, wonderful, great life.
p408
aVAnd everyone was supposed to be happy in that community,
p409
aVand, in fact, my life was hell.
p410
aVI lived with an alcoholic father
p411
aVwho beat me and molested me, and it was all inside that.
p412
aVAnd always as a child I had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me.
p413
aVAnd I actually made up a little character whose name was Mr. Alligator.
p414
aVI would call him up when things got really bad,
p415
aVand say it was time to come and pick me up.
p416
aVAnd I would pack a little bag and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.
p417
aa(lp418
VNow, Mr. Alligator never did come,
p419
aVbut the idea of Mr. Alligator coming actually saved my sanity
p420
aVand made it OK for me to keep going,
p421
aVbecause I believed, in the distance,
p422
aVthere would be someone coming to rescue me.
p423
aa(lp424
VCut to 40-some odd years later,
p425
aVwe go to Kenya, and we're walking,
p426
aVwe arrive at the opening of this house.
p427
aVAnd Agnes hadn't let me come to the house for days,
p428
aVbecause they were preparing this whole ritual.
p429

VI want to tell you a great story.
p431
aVWhen Agnes first started fighting
p432
aVto stop female genital mutilation in her community,
p433
aVshe had become an outcast, and she was exiled and slandered,
p434
aVand the whole community turned against her.
p435
aVBut being a vagina warrior, she kept going,
p436
aVand she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness.
p437
aVAnd in the Maasai community,
p438
aVgoats and cows are the most valued possession.
p439
aVThey're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley.
p440
aVAnd she said two days before the house opened,
p441
aVtwo different people arrived to give her a goat each,
p442
aVand she said to me,
p443
aV"I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa."
p444
aa(lp445
VAnyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,
p446
aVthere were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses \u2014
p447
aVwhich is the color of the Maasai and the color of V-Day \u2014
p448
aVand they greeted us.
p449
aVThey had made up these songs that they were singing,
p450
aVabout the end of suffering and the end of mutilation,
p451
aVand they walked us down the path.
p452
aVIt was a gorgeous day in the African sun,
p453
aVand the dust was flying and the girls were dancing,
p454
aVand there was this house, and it said, "V-Day Safe House for the Girls."
p455
aa(lp456
VAnd it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years,
p457
aVbut that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.
p458
aVAnd he had shown up, obviously,
p459
aVin a form that it took me a long time to understand,
p460
aVwhich is that when we give in the world what we want the most,
p461
aVwe heal the broken part inside each of us.
p462
aa(lp463
VAnd I feel, in the last eight years,
p464
aVthat this journey \u2014 this miraculous vagina journey \u2014
p465
aVhas taught me this really simple thing,
p466
aVwhich is that happiness exists in action;
p467
aVit exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is;
p468
aVand it exists in giving away what you want the most.
p469
aVAnd I feel that knowledge and that journey
p470
aVhas been an extraordinary privilege,
p471
aVand I feel really blessed
p472
aVto have been here today to communicate that to you.
p473
aa(lp474
VThank you very much.
