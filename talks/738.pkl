VI am going to be talking about secrets.
p5
aVObviously the best way to divulge a secret
p6
aVis to tell someone to not say anything about it.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVSecrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year
p9
aVjust because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVAnd when you use these things you don't have to go like that.
p12
aVYou just press it.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVOh, man. Um, yes.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVYes. I'm sure! Just change it!
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVIs Bill Gates here?
p19
aVChange it! Come on! What?
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVAh! Okay.
p22
aVThat's not my slides, but it's okay.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAs you can see, these are all maps.
p26
aVAnd maps are important devices for transferring information,
p27
aVespecially if you have human cognitive ability.
p28
aVWe can see that all formulas are really maps.
p29
aVNow, as humans, we make maps of places
p30
aVthat we seldom even go,
p31
aVwhich seems a little wasteful of time.
p32
aa(lp33
VThis, of course, is a map of the moon.
p34
aVThere're some very delightful names.
p35
aVTranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris.
p36
aVWhat are these people thinking? Frigoris?
p37
aVWhat the Frigoris you doing? Names are important.
p38
aVFrigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day.
p39
aVI'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThere we see Mars, again with various names.
p43
aVAnd this is all done, by the way,
p44
aVby the International Astronomical Union.
p45
aVThis is an actual group of people
p46
aVthat sit around naming planetary objects.
p47
aVThis is from their actual book.
p48
aVThese are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.
p49
aa(lp50
VI'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa.
p51
aVThat, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVNow I think the whole concept of a mermaid
p54
aVdoesn't really blend into the swamp feel.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aV"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!
p57
aVIt's time for Bolotnitsa!"
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VDjabran Fluctus.
p61
aVIf that don't flow off the tongue, what does?
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVI mean kids are studying this stuff
p64
aVand they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVOne dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aV"It fluctus up, Mama."
p69
aa(lp70
VHikuleo Fluctus.
p71
aVThat's a little more flowing. Hikuleo
p72
aVsounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio
p73
aV17 syllable thing.
p74
aVAnd that's the Tonga underworld.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus,
p77
aVwho is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets.
p78
aVNow, if you're a goddess of stars and planets
p79
aVwouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else?
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aV"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.
p82
aVWould you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling.
p83
aVOh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.
p84
aVMonkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures."
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do,
p88
aVit's going to be unfair for the people that are living there
p89
aVto have to live with these ridiculous names.
p90
aVSo, you'll be on Mars, and you're at
p91
aVHellespointica Depressio
p92
aVwhich has got to be a really "up" place.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VYeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis
p96
aVso I plug it into the Mars map,
p97
aVand click the button and there's my directions.
p98
aVI go to Chrysokeras.
p99
aV(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata.
p100
aVThen to Niliacus Lacus,
p101
aVwhich is not a bad name.
p102
aVNiliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.
p103
aVThat's a cool name. I will say that.
p104
aVSo, I hold back a little of my venom
p105
aVfor these astronomical misnomers.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd then of course Arnon to Thoth.
p108
aVAnd of course there will be advertisements.
p109
aVThis is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.
p110
aVAnd you know they're international because
p111
aVthey put it "en Francais" as well.
p112
aVL'Union Astronomique Internationale,
p113
aVfor those of you who don't speak French.
p114
aVI thought I'd translate for you.
p115
aa(lp116
VFrom the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.
p117
aVThe first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.
p118
aVAnd I think that Djabran Fluctus,
p119
aVthat fits that mode.
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aVThat's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple.
p122
aVDjabran Fluctus.
p123
aV"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"
p124
aV"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian?
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVIt's clear to me."
p127
aV"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?"
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAlso, from the actual document
p131
aVI highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.
p132
aVAnyone can suggest changing a name.
p133
aVSo, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.
p134
aVWe've got to change this stuff up fast.
p135
aVSo, these are actual names of people that work there.
p136
aVI did some more investigation.
p137
aVThese are more people working for this group.
p138
aVAnd, as you can see, they don't use their first names.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVThese are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.
p141
aVSomething is askew here.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVIs it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVIs that Ganymede Andromeda Burba?
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVIs that Mars Ya Marov?
p148
aVI don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.
p149
aa(lp150
VThere are some mapping people who do use their names.
p151
aVWitness please, Eugene Shoemaker,
p152
aVwho, diligently, from a young boy
p153
aVdecided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies.
p154
aVMust have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.
p155
aV"Mom, I want to make maps."
p156
aV"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto."
p157
aV"No, I want to make maps of planets."
p158
aV"Yeah, go to your room."
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VMartians, Venusians, Jovians.
p162
aVWe have names for places where people don't exist.
p163
aVThat seems a little silly to me.
p164
aVThere are no Jovians.
p165
aa(lp166
VGetting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way,
p167
aVbecause you don't have to pay anybody for the rights.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aV(Applause)
p170
aVThere is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr,
p171
aVde Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn
p172
aVor Richard Harris.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVIt's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut obviously the point is that numbers are maps.
p177
aVAnd within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?
p178
aVThat is the premise of this particular presentation.
p179
aVBy the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,
p180
aVno adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.
p181
aVSo beautiful that I will even give up a laugh
p182
aVto explain my love of this particular planet,
p183
aVand the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, formulas relate number to form.
p186
aVThat's Euler, his formula
p187
aVwas one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory
p188
aVwhich is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aVHe was also famous for having no body.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVWhich a lot of you are like, "How did he figure that out?"
p193
aVHe's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.
p194
aVHere comes Euler.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd that's an icosahedron,
p198
aVwhich is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.
p199
aVYou see the icosahedron again.
p200
aVThe dodecahedron, it's dual.
p201
aVThere is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.
p202
aVThe five sacred solids, as you can see there.
p203
aVWhich is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVBlue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.
p206
aVI suggest the house.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe reality, now here is something important.
p209
aVWhat's important about this is
p210
aVthese shapes are duals of each other.
p211
aVAnd you can see how the icosahedron
p212
aVwithdraws into the dodecahedron
p213
aVand then they just merge into each other.
p214
aVSo, the whole concept of branes in the universe,
p215
aVif the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron
p216
aVthis is a very good map of what could possibly be.
p217
aVAnd that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.
p218
aa(lp219
VWhat a coincidence!
p220
aVOctober 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet
p221
aVsaid that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,
p222
aVbased on information that they got from this probe.
p223
aVThis would be a normal wave pattern.
p224
aVBut what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches
p225
aVof the microwave background,
p226
aVis this kind of odd undulation.
p227
aVIt doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, you can kind of get an idea from this
p230
aVextrapolating that back under this huge picture,
p231
aVso we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.
p232
aVAnd judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVSo, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.
p235
aVAnd for me, that's a win-win.
p236
aVEverybody goes, I'm happy.
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVBetter really hurry up.
p239
aa(lp240
VI just threw this in because
p241
aVas important as all of our intellectual abilities are,
p242
aVwithout heart and without love it's just \u2014 it's all meaningless.
p243
aVAnd that, to me, is really beautiful.
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVExcept for that creepy guy in the background.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VGetting back to the point of my particular presentation,
p249
aVKepler, one of my great heroes,
p250
aVwho realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,
p251
aVwere related somehow to the planets,
p252
aVbut he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.
p253
aVBut it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.
p254
aVSo, maps of things leading to organized understandings
p255
aVof the universe in which we emerge.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aVI am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters
p260
aVcould maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVthat's not a good picture.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVNot a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis
p265
aVare a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.
p266
aVThat guy is rockin'.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aVWhat a handsome cat.
p269
aa(lp270
VOnce again, Nicaragua let me down.
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVAnd Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVI don't get that at all.
p275
aVOnce again, these guys rock it out.
p276
aVIsaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.
p277
aVThis is freaky is a major way.
p278
aVThis is Sierra Leone.
p279
aVThey got little babies in there, floating in there.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VMan. I don't really need to comment on this.
p283
aVBut I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aVWhen did this happen?
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVIt's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?
p288
aVI mean these guys are extrapolating in realms
p289
aVthat are not necessarily valid.
p290
aVAlthough five is a good number, of course.
p291
aa(lp292
VEcuador, my friend Kepler,
p293
aVas you can see, they call him Juan.
p294
aV(Laughter)
p295
aVJuan? No! Johannes, not Juan.
p296
aVIt wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VRené Descartes, of course. Once again
p300
aVthese Grenada people, this is like way too sick
p301
aVfor anybody's imagination.
p302
aVHe's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,
p303
aVlittle ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up
p304
aVfast, ladies and gentlemen.
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VThis is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.
p308
aVOnce again, that's Sierra Leone.
p309
aVThis is again, indicating how numbers
p310
aVrelate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.
p311
aVBecause that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.
p312
aa(lp313
VDescartes. (Laughter)
p314
aVBefore the horse. (Laughter)
p315
aVNow, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.
p316
aVNow, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.
p317
aVHere is a map. All they have is a casino on it.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVAnd why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map
p320
aVI don't even want to hazard a guess.
p321
aVBut I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VThis is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,
p325
aVthe flag of Indonesia. Please examine.
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aV(Applause)
p328
aVNot sure how this came to be, but it's not right.
p329
aVIn Monaco, "No, what are you talking about?
p330
aVThey are so different.
p331
aVLook, ours is more red, it's longer.
p332
aVThey stole our flag! They stole our flag!"
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VBode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.
p336
aVAnd the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.
p337
aVThat's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.
p338
aV(Laughter)
p339
aVJust a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.
p340
aa(lp341
VAnd I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude,
p342
aVcould you touch your tooth? That's good."
p343
aVJust a tip, if you're being photographed
p344
aVfor press pictures, don't touch your teeth.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VPrime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.
p348
aVGolden section, I've been obsessed with this thing
p349
aVsince before I was born.
p350
aVI know that scares a lot of you,
p351
aVbut that was my purpose entirely.
p352
aVThere we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,
p353
aVbecause Fibonacci and Golden Section
p354
aVrelate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.
p355
aVIf Fibonacci had been on Paxil,
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aVthat would be the Fibonacci series.
p358
aV"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."
p359
aV"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills."
p360
aV"Yes, Mama."
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VAlright where is this going? That's a good question.
p364
aVHere is the premise that I began 27 years ago.
p365
aVIf numbers can express
p366
aVthe laws of this incredible universe that we live,
p367
aVI reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,
p368
aVwe could extrapolate from them
p369
aVsome basic structural element of this universe.
p370
aVAnd that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago
p371
aVI started working on this.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd I tried to build a particle accelerator.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aVAnd that didn't work out well.
p376
aVSo, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.
p377
aVI can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.
p378
aVThat's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.
p379
aVMoleeds are what I believe
p380
aVthe thing that will allow string theory to be proved.
p381
aVThey are the nodes on the string,
p382
aVpatterns and relationships, 27, 37.
p383
aVThat was the first chart I came up with.
p384
aa(lp385
VYou can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,
p386
aVthe beauty of the symmetry.
p387
aVThe numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.
p388
aVSymmetry, pairs.
p389
aVEvery top adds up to 37.
p390
aVBottom, all 74.
p391
aVThere is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,
p392
aVbecause you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."
p393
aV(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VCircle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.
p396
aVI knew those two were related.
p397
aVOnce again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.
p398
aVSo, I said if I'm going to put a circle,
p399
aVsee what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.
p400
aVLook at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.
p401
aV(Laughter)
p402
aVYou can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle
p403
aVand they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,
p404
aVand it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out."
p405
aa(lp406
VThis is beyond anything anybody could just make up.
p407
aVThere is the Orange System.
p408
aV(Laughter)
p409
aVAnd you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.
p410
aVAnd they recapitulate that shape,
p411
aVeven though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.
p412
aV(Laughter)
p413
aVThat's the Green System. It all folds in half
p414
aVon the Green System, right between 18 and 19.
p415
aVThe Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.
p416
aV(Laughter)
p417
aVLook at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.
p418
aV(Laughter)
p419
aVThat just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.
p420
aVTwenty-seven years of my life!
p421
aV(Laughter)
p422
aVAnd I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?
p423
aVBecause this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.
p424
aV(Laughter)
p425
aV"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."
p426
aV(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VIn this last year I have found these subsequent systems
p429
aVwhich allow for the mathematic possibilities
p430
aVof the Calabi-Yau manifolds
p431
aVin a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.
p432
aVWhich works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.
p433
aVIt just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.
p434
aVI don't want hidden, I want to see it.
p435
aV(Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VI found other pairs all have symmetry,
p438
aVeven though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.
p439
aVUnbelievable. This is like crazy.
p440
aVAm I the only one that sees this?
p441
aV(Laughter)
p442
aVYou know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.
p443
aVYou know, try making some charts like this at home.
p444
aVYou gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.
p445
aVThese are maps, by the way.
p446
aVNot stamps, but one day.
p447
aV(Laughter)
p448
aa(lp449
VOkay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.
p450
aVAnd look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.
p451
aVI start looking at that, and look at them again.
p452
aVThey start looking like planets.
p453
aVI go to JPL.
p454
aVI look at the orbits of the planets.
p455
