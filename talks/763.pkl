VI am going to speak about corruption,
p5
aVbut I would like to juxtapose
p6
aVtwo different things.
p7
aVOne is the large global economy,
p8
aVthe large globalized economy,
p9
aVand the other one is the small, and very limited,
p10
aVcapacity of our traditional governments
p11
aVand their international institutions
p12
aVto govern, to shape, this economy.
p13
aVBecause there is this asymmetry,
p14
aVwhich creates, basically,
p15
aVfailing governance.
p16
aVFailing governance in many areas:
p17
aVin the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,
p18
aVin the area of exploitation of women and children,
p19
aVin the area of climate change,
p20
aVin all the areas in which we really need
p21
aVa capacity to reintroduce
p22
aVthe primacy of politics
p23
aVinto the economy,
p24
aVwhich is operating in a worldwide arena.
p25
aVAnd I think corruption,
p26
aVand the fight against corruption,
p27
aVand the impact of corruption,
p28
aVis probably one of the most interesting ways
p29
aVto illustrate what I mean
p30
aVwith this failure of governance.
p31
aa(lp32
VLet me talk about my own experience.
p33
aVI used to work as the director
p34
aVof the World Bank office in Nairobi
p35
aVfor East Africa.
p36
aVAt that time, I noticed
p37
aVthat corruption, that grand corruption,
p38
aVthat systematic corruption,
p39
aVwas undermining everything we were trying to do.
p40
aVAnd therefore, I began
p41
aVto not only try to protect
p42
aVthe work of the World Bank,
p43
aVour own projects, our own programs
p44
aVagainst corruption,
p45
aVbut in general, I thought, "We need a system
p46
aVto protect the people
p47
aVin this part of the world
p48
aVfrom the ravages of corruption."
p49
aVAnd as soon as I started this work,
p50
aVI received a memorandum from the World Bank,
p51
aVfrom the legal department first,
p52
aVin which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.
p53
aVYou are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.
p54
aVThis is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,
p55
aVso I want you to stop your doings."
p56
aa(lp57
VIn the meantime, I was chairing
p58
aVdonor meetings, for instance,
p59
aVin which the various donors,
p60
aVand many of them like to be in Nairobi \u2014
p61
aVit is true, it is one of the
p62
aVunsafest cities of the world,
p63
aVbut they like to be there because the other cities
p64
aVare even less comfortable.
p65
aVAnd in these donor meetings, I noticed
p66
aVthat many of the worst projects \u2014
p67
aVwhich were put forward
p68
aVby our clients, by the governments,
p69
aVby promoters,
p70
aVmany of them representing
p71
aVsuppliers from the North \u2014
p72
aVthat the worst projects
p73
aVwere realized first.
p74
aVLet me give you an example:
p75
aVa huge power project,
p76
aV300 million dollars,
p77
aVto be built smack into
p78
aVone of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,
p79
aVareas of western Kenya.
p80
aVAnd we all noticed immediately
p81
aVthat this project had no economic benefits:
p82
aVIt had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,
p83
aVnobody was interested in irrigation projects.
p84
aVTo the contrary, we knew that this project
p85
aVwould destroy the environment:
p86
aVIt would destroy riparian forests,
p87
aVwhich were the basis for
p88
aVthe survival of nomadic groups,
p89
aVthe Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
p90
aVSo everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,
p91
aVthis is an absolute damaging, a terrible project \u2014
p92
aVnot to speak about the future indebtedness of the country
p93
aVfor these hundreds of millions of dollars,
p94
aVand the siphoning off
p95
aVof the scarce resources of the economy
p96
aVfrom much more important activities
p97
aVlike schools, like hospitals and so on.
p98
aVAnd yet, we all rejected this project,
p99
aVnone of the donors was willing
p100
aVto have their name connected with it,
p101
aVand it was the first project to be implemented.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe good projects, which we as a donor community
p104
aVwould take under our wings,
p105
aVthey took years, you know,
p106
aVyou had too many studies,
p107
aVand very often they didn't succeed.
p108
aVBut these bad projects,
p109
aVwhich were absolutely damaging \u2014 for the economy
p110
aVfor many generations, for the environment,
p111
aVfor thousands of families who had to be resettled \u2014
p112
aVthey were suddenly put together
p113
aVby consortia of banks,
p114
aVof supplier agencies,
p115
aVof insurance agencies \u2014
p116
aVlike in Germany, Hermes, and so on \u2014
p117
aVand they came back very, very quickly,
p118
aVdriven by an unholy alliance
p119
aVbetween the powerful elites
p120
aVin the countries there
p121
aVand the suppliers from the North.
p122
aVNow, these suppliers
p123
aVwere our big companies.
p124
aVThey were the actors of this global market,
p125
aVwhich I mentioned in the beginning.
p126
aVThey were the Siemenses of this world,
p127
aVcoming from France, from the UK, from Japan,
p128
aVfrom Canada, from Germany,
p129
aVand they were systematically driven
p130
aVby systematic, large-scale corruption.
p131
aVWe are not talking about
p132
aV50,000 dollars here,
p133
aVor 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.
p134
aVNo, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars
p135
aVon the Swiss bank accounts,
p136
aVon the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,
p137
aVof the president's ministers,
p138
aVthe high officials in the para-statal sectors.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis was the reality which I saw,
p141
aVand not only one project like that:
p142
aVI saw, I would say,
p143
aVover the years I worked in Africa,
p144
aVI saw hundreds of projects like this.
p145
aVAnd so, I became convinced
p146
aVthat it is this systematic corruption
p147
aVwhich is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,
p148
aVwhich is the main reason
p149
aVfor the misery, for the poverty,
p150
aVfor the conflicts, for the violence,
p151
aVfor the desperation
p152
aVin many of these countries.
p153
aVThat we have today
p154
aVmore than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,
p155
aVthat we have more than a billion people
p156
aVwithout proper drinking water in the world,
p157
aVtwice that number,
p158
aVmore than two billion people
p159
aVwithout sanitation and so on,
p160
aVand the consequent illnesses
p161
aVof mothers and children,
p162
aVstill, child mortality of more than
p163
aV10 million people every year,
p164
aVchildren dying before they are five years old:
p165
aVThe cause of this is, to a large extent,
p166
aVgrand corruption.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, why did the World Bank
p169
aVnot let me do this work?
p170
aVI found out afterwards,
p171
aVafter I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.
p172
aVThe reason was that the members of the World Bank
p173
aVthought that foreign bribery was okay,
p174
aVincluding Germany.
p175
aVIn Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
p176
aVIt was even tax-deductible.
p177
aVNo wonder that most of the most important
p178
aVinternational operators in Germany,
p179
aVbut also in France and the UK
p180
aVand Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.
p181
aVNot all of them, but most of them.
p182
aVAnd this is the phenomenon
p183
aVwhich I call failing governance,
p184
aVbecause when I then came to Germany
p185
aVand started this little NGO
p186
aVhere in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,
p187
aVwe were told, "You cannot stop
p188
aVour German exporters from bribing,
p189
aVbecause we will lose our contracts.
p190
aVWe will lose to the French,
p191
aVwe will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."
p192
aVAnd therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,
p193
aVwhich made it very difficult
p194
aVfor an individual company,
p195
aVan individual exporting country
p196
aVto say, "We are not going to
p197
aVcontinue this deadly, disastrous
p198
aVhabit of large companies to bribe."
p199
aa(lp200
VSo this is what I mean
p201
aVwith a failing governance structure,
p202
aVbecause even the powerful government,
p203
aVwhich we have in Germany, comparatively,
p204
aVwas not able to say,
p205
aV"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."
p206
aVThey needed help,
p207
aVand the large companies themselves
p208
aVhave this dilemma.
p209
aVMany of them didn't want to bribe.
p210
aVMany of the German companies, for instance,
p211
aVbelieve that they are really
p212
aVproducing a high-quality product
p213
aVat a good price, so they are very competitive.
p214
aVThey are not as good at bribing
p215
aVas many of their international competitors are,
p216
aVbut they were not allowed
p217
aVto show their strengths,
p218
aVbecause the world was eaten up
p219
aVby grand corruption.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd this is why I'm telling you this:
p222
aVCivil society rose to the occasion.
p223
aVWe had this small NGO,
p224
aVTransparency International.
p225
aVThey began to think of
p226
aVan escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,
p227
aVand we developed concepts
p228
aVof collective action,
p229
aVbasically trying to bring various competitors
p230
aVtogether around the table,
p231
aVexplaining to all of them
p232
aVhow much it would be in their interests
p233
aVif they simultaneously would stop bribing,
p234
aVand to make a long story short,
p235
aVwe managed to eventually
p236
aVget Germany to sign
p237
aVtogether with the other OECD countries
p238
aVand a few other exporters.
p239
aa(lp240
VIn 1997, a convention,
p241
aVunder the auspices of the OECD,
p242
aVwhich obliged everybody
p243
aVto change their laws
p244
aVand criminalize foreign bribery.
p245
aV(Applause)
p246
aVWell, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,
p247
aVin doing this,
p248
aVwe had to sit together with the companies.
p249
aVWe had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,
p250
aVwe had sessions with about
p251
aV20 captains of industry,
p252
aVand we discussed with them
p253
aVwhat to do about international bribery.
p254
aVIn the first session \u2014 we had three sessions
p255
aVover the course of two years.
p256
aVAnd President von Weizsäcker, by the way,
p257
aVchaired one of the sessions, the first one,
p258
aVto take the fear away
p259
aVfrom the entrepreneurs,
p260
aVwho were not used to deal
p261
aVwith non-governmental organizations.
p262
aVAnd in the first session, they all said,
p263
aV"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.
p264
aVThis is what these other cultures demand.
p265
aVThey even applaud it.
p266
aVIn fact, [unclear]
p267
aVstill says this today.
p268
aVAnd so there are still a lot of people
p269
aVwho are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.
p270
aVBut in the second session,
p271
aVthey admitted already that they would never do this,
p272
aVwhat they are doing in these other countries,
p273
aVhere in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.
p274
aVCabinet ministers would admit this.
p275
aVAnd in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,
p276
aVwe had them all sign an open letter
p277
aVto the Kohl government, at the time,
p278
aVrequesting that they
p279
aVparticipate in the OECD convention.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd this is, in my opinion,
p282
aVan example of soft power,
p283
aVbecause we were able to convince them
p284
aVthat they had to go with us.
p285
aVWe had a longer-term time perspective.
p286
aVWe had a broader,
p287
aVgeographically much wider,
p288
aVconstituency we were trying to defend.
p289
aVAnd that's why the law has changed.
p290
aVThat's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in
p291
aVand that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.
p292
aVIn some other countries, the OECD convention
p293
aVis not yet properly enforced.
p294
aVAnd, again, civil societies
p295
aVbreathing down the neck of the establishment.
p296
aa(lp297
VIn London, for instance,
p298
aVwhere the BAE got away
p299
aVwith a huge corruption case,
p300
aVwhich the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,
p301
aV100 million British pounds,
p302
aVevery year for ten years,
p303
aVto one particular official of one particular friendly country,
p304
aVwho then bought for
p305
aV44 billion pounds of military equipment.
p306
aVThis case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.
p307
aVWhy? Because they consider this
p308
aVas contrary to the security interest
p309
aVof the people of Great Britain.
p310
aVCivil society is pushing, civil society
p311
aVis trying to get a solution to this problem,
p312
aValso in the U.K.,
p313
aVand also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,
p314
aVand so on.
p315
aa(lp316
VIn Germany, we are pushing
p317
aVthe ratification of the UN convention,
p318
aVwhich is a subsequent convention.
p319
aVWe are, Germany, is not ratifying.
p320
aVWhy? Because it would make it necessary
p321
aVto criminalize the corruption
p322
aVof deputies.
p323
aVIn Germany, we have a system where
p324
aVyou are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,
p325
aVbut you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
p326
aVThis is, under German law, allowed,
p327
aVand the members of our parliament don't want to change this,
p328
aVand this is why they can't sign
p329
aVthe U.N. convention against foreign bribery \u2014
p330
aVone of they very, very few countries
p331
aVwhich is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,
p332
aVbut not able to ratify the convention,
p333
aVwhich we managed to get on the books
p334
aVwith about 160 countries all over the world.
p335
aa(lp336
VI see my time is ticking.
p337
aVLet me just try to
p338
aVdraw some conclusions from what has happened.
p339
aVI believe that what we managed to achieve
p340
aVin fighting corruption,
p341
aVone can also achieve
p342
aVin other areas of failing governance.
p343
aVBy now, the United Nations
p344
aVis totally on our side.
p345
aVThe World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,
p346
aVthey became, I would say, the strongest
p347
aVanti-corruption agency in the world.
p348
aVMost of the large companies
p349
aVare now totally convinced
p350
aVthat they have to put in place
p351
aVvery strong policies
p352
aVagainst bribery and so on.
p353
aVAnd this is possible because civil society
p354
aVjoined the companies
p355
aVand joined the government
p356
aVin the analysis of the problem,
p357
aVin the development of remedies,
p358
aVin the implementation of reforms,
p359
aVand then later, in the monitoring of reforms.
p360
aa(lp361
VOf course, if civil society organizations
p362
aVwant to play that role,
p363
aVthey have to grow into this responsibility.
p364
aVNot all civil society organizations are good.
p365
aVThe Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.
p366
aVSo, we must be aware
p367
aVthat civil society
p368
aVhas to shape up itself.
p369
aVThey have to have a much more
p370
aVtransparent financial governance.
p371
aVThey have to have a much more participatory governance
p372
aVin many civil society organizations.
p373
aVWe also need much more competence of civil society leaders.
p374
aVThis is why we have set up the governance school
p375
aVand the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,
p376
aVbecause we believe most of our educational
p377
aVand research institutions in Germany
p378
aVand continental Europe in general,
p379
aVdo not focus enough, yet,
p380
aVon empowering civil society
p381
aVand training the leadership of civil society.
p382
aa(lp383
VBut what I'm saying from my very practical experience:
p384
aVIf civil society does it right
p385
aVand joins the other actors \u2014
p386
aVin particular, governments,
p387
aVgovernments and their international institutions,
p388
aVbut also large international actors,
p389
aVin particular those which have committed themselves
p390
aVto corporate social responsibility \u2014
p391
aVthen in this magical triangle
p392
aVbetween civil society,
p393
aVgovernment and private sector,
p394
aVthere is a tremendous chance
p395
aVfor all of us to create a better world.
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you.
