VI'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
p5
aVAnd that might seem a bit surprising,
p6
aVbecause my full-time work at the foundation
p7
aVis mostly about vaccines and seeds,
p8
aVabout the things that we need to invent and deliver
p9
aVto help the poorest two billion live better lives.
p10
aVBut energy and climate are extremely important to these people;
p11
aVin fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.
p12
aVThe climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:
p13
aVthere will be too much rain, not enough rain;
p14
aVthings will change in ways their fragile environment simply can't support.
p15
aVAnd that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.
p16
aVSo, the climate changes will be terrible for them.
p17
aa(lp18
VAlso, the price of energy is very important to them.
p19
aVIn fact, if you could pick just one thing
p20
aVto lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.
p21
aVNow, the price of energy has come down over time.
p22
aVReally advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.
p23
aVThe coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,
p24
aVand, even in the 1900s, we've seen a very rapid decline
p25
aVin the price of electricity,
p26
aVand that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning;
p27
aVwe can make modern materials and do so many things.
p28
aVAnd so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
p29
aVBut as we make it cheaper \u2014 and let's say,
p30
aVlet's go for making it twice as cheap \u2014
p31
aVwe need to meet a new constraint,
p32
aVand that constraint has to do with CO2.
p33
aa(lp34
VCO2 is warming the planet,
p35
aVand the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.
p36
aVIf you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,
p37
aVthat leads to a temperature increase,
p38
aVand that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:
p39
aVthe effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,
p40
aVin that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,
p41
aVand so you get ecosystem collapses.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2
p44
aVto what temperature will be, and where the positive feedbacks are \u2014
p45
aVthere's some uncertainty there, but not very much.
p46
aVAnd there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,
p47
aVbut they will be extremely bad.
p48
aVI asked the top scientists on this several times:
p49
aVDo we really have to get down to near zero?
p50
aVCan't we just cut it in half or a quarter?
p51
aVAnd the answer is, until we get near to zero,
p52
aVthe temperature will continue to rise.
p53
aVAnd so that's a big challenge.
p54
aVIt's very different than saying,
p55
aV"We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,
p56
aVand we can just sort of squeeze under."
p57
aVThis is something that has to get to zero.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year \u2014
p60
aVover 26 billion tons.
p61
aVFor each American, it's about 20 tons.
p62
aVFor people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.
p63
aVIt's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.
p64
aVAnd somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero.
p65
aVIt's been constantly going up.
p66
aVIt's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,
p67
aVso we have to go from rapidly rising to falling,
p68
aVand falling all the way to zero.
p69
aa(lp70
VThis equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.
p71
aVSo you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,
p72
aVand that's going to be based on the number of people,
p73
aVthe services each person is using on average,
p74
aVthe energy, on average, for each service,
p75
aVand the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
p76
aVSo let's look at each one of these,
p77
aVand see how we can get this down to zero.
p78
aVProbably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VThat's back from high school algebra.
p83
aVBut let's take a look.
p84
aa(lp85
VFirst, we've got population.
p86
aVThe world today has 6.8 billion people.
p87
aVThat's headed up to about nine billion.
p88
aVNow, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,
p89
aVhealth care, reproductive health services,
p90
aVwe could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.
p91
aVBut there, we see an increase of about 1.3.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe second factor is the services we use.
p94
aVThis encompasses everything:
p95
aVthe food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.
p96
aVThese are very good things.
p97
aVGetting rid of poverty means providing these services
p98
aVto almost everyone on the planet.
p99
aVAnd it's a great thing for this number to go up.
p100
aVIn the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,
p101
aVwe probably could cut back and use less,
p102
aVbut every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,
p103
aVand so, overall, that will more than double
p104
aVthe services delivered per person.
p105
aVHere we have a very basic service:
p106
aVDo you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?
p107
aVAnd, in fact, these kids don't,
p108
aVso they're going out and reading their schoolwork
p109
aVunder the street lamps.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, efficiency, "E," the energy for each service \u2014
p112
aVhere, finally we have some good news.
p113
aVWe have something that's not going up.
p114
aVThrough various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,
p115
aVthrough different types of cars, different ways of building buildings \u2014
p116
aVthere are a lot of services
p117
aVwhere you can bring the energy for that service down
p118
aVquite substantially.
p119
aVSome individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.
p120
aVThere are other services, like how we make fertilizer,
p121
aVor how we do air transport,
p122
aVwhere the rooms for improvement are far, far less.
p123
aVAnd so overall, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction
p124
aVof a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.
p125
aVBut for these first three factors now,
p126
aVwe've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,
p127
aVand that just won't cut it.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo let's look at this fourth factor \u2014 this is going to be a key one \u2014
p130
aVand this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.
p131
aVSo the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?
p132
aVIf you burn coal, no.
p133
aVIf you burn natural gas, no.
p134
aVAlmost every way we make electricity today,
p135
aVexcept for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.
p136
aVAnd so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,
p137
aVis create a new system.
p138
aVSo we need energy miracles.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.
p141
aVThe microprocessor is a miracle.
p142
aVThe personal computer is a miracle.
p143
aVThe Internet and its services are a miracle.
p144
aVSo the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.
p145
aVUsually, we don't have a deadline
p146
aVwhere you have to get the miracle by a certain date.
p147
aVUsually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.
p148
aVThis is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed
p149
aVand get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, I thought, "How could I really capture this?
p152
aVIs there some kind of natural illustration,
p153
aVsome demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"
p154
aVI thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes,
p155
aVand somehow people enjoyed that.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VIt really got them involved in the idea of, you know,
p160
aVthere are people who live with mosquitoes.
p161
aVWith energy, all I could come up with is this.
p162
aVI decided that releasing fireflies
p163
aVwould be my contribution to the environment here this year.
p164
aVSo here we have some natural fireflies.
p165
aVI'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,
p170
aVbut they don't really add up to much.
p171
aVWe need solutions, either one or several,
p172
aVthat have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability.
p173
aVAnd although there's many directions that people are seeking,
p174
aVI really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.
p175
aVI've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
p176
aVThose may make some contribution,
p177
aVand if they can do better than I expect, so much the better.
p178
aVBut my key point here is that we're going to have to work on
p179
aVeach of these five,
p180
aVand we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,
p181
aVbecause they all have significant challenges.
p182
aa(lp183
VLet's look first at burning fossil fuels,
p184
aVeither burning coal or burning natural gas.
p185
aVWhat you need to do there seems like it might be simple, but it's not.
p186
aVAnd that's to take all the CO2,
p187
aVafter you've burned it, going out the flue,
p188
aVpressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,
p189
aVand hope it stays there.
p190
aVNow, we have some pilot things
p191
aVthat do this at the 60 to 80 percent level.
p192
aVBut getting up to that full percentage \u2014 that will be very tricky.
p193
aVAnd agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,
p194
aVbut the toughest one here is this long-term issue:
p195
aVWho's going to be sure?
p196
aVWho's going to guarantee
p197
aVsomething that is literally billions of times larger
p198
aVthan any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?
p199
aVThis is a lot of volume.
p200
aVSo that's a tough one.
p201
aa(lp202
VNext would be nuclear.
p203
aVIt also has three big problems:
p204
aVcost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;
p205
aVthe issue of safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,
p206
aVthat, even though you have these human operators,
p207
aVthe fuel doesn't get used for weapons.
p208
aVAnd then what do you do with the waste?
p209
aVAlthough it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.
p210
aVPeople need to feel good about it.
p211
aVSo three very tough problems that might be solvable,
p212
aVand so, should be worked on.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe last three of the five, I've grouped together.
p215
aVThese are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.
p216
aVAnd they actually \u2014 although it's great they don't require fuel \u2014
p217
aVthey have some disadvantages.
p218
aVOne is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies
p219
aVis dramatically less than a power plant.
p220
aVThis is energy farming,
p221
aVso you're talking about many square miles, thousands of times more area
p222
aVthan you think of as a normal energy plant.
p223
aVAlso, these are intermittent sources.
p224
aVThe sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,
p225
aVand likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.
p226
aVAnd so, if you depend on these sources,
p227
aVyou have to have some way of getting the energy
p228
aVduring those time periods that it's not available.
p229
aVSo we've got big cost challenges here.
p230
aVWe have transmission challenges;
p231
aVfor example, say this energy source is outside your country,
p232
aVyou not only need the technology,
p233
aVbut you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd, finally, this storage problem.
p236
aVTo dimensionalize this,
p237
aVI went through and looked at all the types of batteries made \u2014
p238
aVfor cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything \u2014
p239
aVand compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses.
p240
aVWhat I found is that all the batteries we make now
p241
aVcould store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.
p242
aVAnd so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,
p243
aVsomething that's going to be a factor of 100 better
p244
aVthan the approaches we have now.
p245
aVIt's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.
p246
aVNow, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source
p247
aVto be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.
p248
aVIf you're counting on it for 100 percent,
p249
aVyou need an incredible miracle battery.
p250
aa(lp251
VNow, how are we going to go forward on this \u2014 what's the right approach?
p252
aVIs it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?
p253
aVWell, we need lots of companies working on this \u2014 hundreds.
p254
aVIn each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.
p255
aVA lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy."
p256
aVThat's good.
p257
aVAnd, I think, here in the TED group,
p258
aVwe have many people who are already pursuing this.
p259
aVBill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar
p260
aVthat has some great solar thermal technologies.
p261
aVVinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies
p262
aVthat are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,
p263
aVand I'm trying to help back that.
p264
aVNathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company
p265
aVthat, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.
p266
aVThere are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.
p267
aVInnovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,
p268
aVso the idea that there's some good ideas laying around
p269
aVis not all that surprising.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium \u2014
p272
aVthe one percent, which is the U235 \u2014
p273
aVwe decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238."
p274
aVIt is kind of a crazy idea.
p275
aVIn fact, people had talked about it for a long time,
p276
aVbut they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,
p277
aVand so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers
p278
aVthat now you can simulate and see that, yes,
p279
aVwith the right materials approach, this looks like it would work.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd because you're burning that 99 percent,
p282
aVyou have greatly improved cost profile.
p283
aVYou actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel
p284
aVall the leftover waste from today's reactors.
p285
aVSo instead of worrying about them, you just take that, it's a great thing.
p286
aVIt breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.
p287
aVYou see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.
p288
aVIn terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.
p289
aVI've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.
p290
aVThis is the leftover, the 99 percent,
p291
aVwhere they've taken out the part they burn now,
p292
aVso it's called depleted uranium.
p293
aVThat would power the US for hundreds of years.
p294
aVAnd simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,
p295
aVyou'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,
p298
aVbut it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas
p299
aVthat we need to move forward.
p300
aVSo let's think: How should we measure ourselves?
p301
aVWhat should our report card look like?
p302
aVWell, let's go out to where we really need to get,
p303
aVand then look at the intermediate.
p304
aVFor 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.
p305
aVThat really is very important, that we get there.
p306
aVAnd that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries \u2014
p307
aVstill some agriculture; hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.
p308
aVSo, to get to that 80 percent,
p309
aVthe developed countries, including countries like China,
p310
aVwill have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.
p311
aVThe other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,
p312
aVhave we deployed it in all the developed countries
p313
aVand are in the process of getting it elsewhere?
p314
aVThat's super important.
p315
aVThat's a key element of making that report card.
p316
aa(lp317
VBacking up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?
p318
aVWell, again, it should have the two elements.
p319
aVWe should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:
p320
aVThe less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,
p321
aVand therefore, the less the temperature.
p322
aVBut in some ways, the grade we get there,
p323
aVdoing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,
p324
aVis only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,
p325
aVwhich is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.
p326
aa(lp327
VThese breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,
p328
aVand we can measure that in terms of companies,
p329
aVpilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.
p330
aVThere's a lot of great books that have been written about this.
p331
aVThe Al Gore book, "Our Choice,"
p332
aVand the David MacKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
p333
aVThey really go through it and create a framework
p334
aVthat this can be discussed broadly,
p335
aVbecause we need broad backing for this.
p336
aVThere's a lot that has to come together.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo this is a wish.
p339
aVIt's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.
p340
aVIf you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years \u2014
p341
aVI could pick who's president,
p342
aVI could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,
p343
aVor I could pick that this thing
p344
aVthat's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented \u2014
p345
aVthis is the wish I would pick.
p346
aVThis is the one with the greatest impact.
p347
aVIf we don't get this wish,
p348
aVthe division between the people who think short term and long term
p349
aVwill be terrible,
p350
aVbetween the US and China, between poor countries and rich,
p351
aVand most of all,
p352
aVthe lives of those two billion will be far worse.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo what do we have to do?
p355
aVWhat am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?
p356
aVWe need to go for more research funding.
p357
aVWhen countries get together in places like Copenhagen,
p358
aVthey shouldn't just discuss the CO2.
p359
aVThey should discuss this innovation agenda.
p360
aVYou'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending
p361
aVon these innovative approaches.
p362
aVWe do need the market incentives \u2014 CO2 tax, cap and trade \u2014
p363
aVsomething that gets that price signal out there.
p364
aVWe need to get the message out.
p365
aVWe need to have this dialogue be a more rational,
p366
aVmore understandable dialogue,
p367
aVincluding the steps that the government takes.
p368
aVThis is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.
p369
aa(lp370
VThank you.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
p373
aV(Applause ends)
p374
aa(lp375
VThank you.
p376
aa(lp377
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VCA: Thank you.
p382
aVSo to understand more about TerraPower.
p383
aVI mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?
p384
aa(lp385
VBill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,
p386
aVhire all the great scientists, which we've done,
p387
aVthat's only tens of millions.
p388
aVAnd even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor
p389
aVto make sure our materials work properly,
p390
aVthen you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.
p391
aVThe tough thing is building the pilot reactor \u2014
p392
aVfinding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location
p393
aVthat will actually build the first one of these.
p394
aVOnce you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,
p395
aVthen it's just clear as day,
p396
aVbecause the economics, the energy density, are so different
p397
aVthan nuclear as we know it.
p398
aa(lp399
VCA: So to understand it right,
p400
aVthis involves building deep into the ground,
p401
aValmost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,
p402
aVand then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?
p403
aa(lp404
VBG: That's right.
p405
aVToday, you're always refueling the reactor,
p406
aVso you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong,
p407
aVwhere you're opening it up and moving things in and out \u2014
p408
aVthat's not good.
p409
aVSo if you have very \u2014
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
Vvery cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in \u2014
p414
aVjust think of it as a log \u2014
p415
aVput it down and not have those same complexities.
p416
aVAnd it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.
p417
aa(lp418
VCA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.
p419
aa(lp420
VBG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,
p421
aVyou can let it sit there \u2014 there's a lot less waste under this approach \u2014
p422
aVthen you can actually take that
p423
aVand put it into another one and burn that.
p424
aVAnd we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today
p425
aVthat's sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors \u2014
p426
aVthat's our fuel to begin with.
p427
aVSo the thing that's been a problem from those reactors
p428
aVis actually what gets fed into ours,
p429
aVand you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically
p430
aVas you're going through this process.
p431
aa(lp432
VCA: You're talking to different people around the world
p433
aVabout the possibilities.
p434
aVWhere is there most interest in actually doing something with this?
p435
aa(lp436
VBG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,
p437
aVand there's all these interesting disclosure rules
p438
aVabout anything that's called "nuclear."
p439
aVSo we've got a lot of interest.
p440
aVPeople from the company have been in Russia, India, China.
p441
aVI've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,
p442
aVtalking about how this fits into the energy agenda.
p443
aVSo I'm optimistic.
p444
aVThe French and Japanese have done some work.
p445
aVThis is a variant on something that has been done.
p446
aVIt's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,
p447
aVand a lot of countries have built them,
p448
aVso anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate
p449
aVto be where the first one gets built.
p450
aa(lp451
VCA: So, in your mind,
p452
aVtimescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live?
p453
aa(lp454
VBG: Well, we need \u2014 for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things
p455
aVthat's very cheap,
p456
aVwe have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.
p457
aVThat's sort of the deadline
p458
aVthat the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet.
p459
aVAnd TerraPower \u2014 if things go well, which is wishing for a lot \u2014
p460
aVcould easily meet that.
p461
aVAnd there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies \u2014
p462
aVwe need it to be hundreds \u2014
p463
aVwho, likewise, if their science goes well,
p464
aVif the funding for their pilot plants goes well,
p465
aVthat they can compete for this.
p466
aVAnd it's best if multiple succeed,
p467
aVbecause then you could use a mix of these things.
p468
aVWe certainly need one to succeed.
p469
aa(lp470
VCA: In terms of big-scale possible game changers,
p471
aVis this the biggest that you're aware of out there?
p472
aa(lp473
VBG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
p474
aVIt would have been, even without the environmental constraint,
p475
aVbut the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.
p476
aVIn the nuclear space, there are other innovators.
p477
aVYou know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,
p478
aVbut the modular people, that's a different approach.
p479
aVThere's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,
p480
aVbut maybe they say that about us.
p481
aVAnd so, there are different ones,
p482
aVbut the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium
p483
aVhas a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal.
p484
aVAnd so, if you can deal with the negatives,
p485
aVwhich are essentially the radiation, the footprint and cost,
p486
aVthe potential, in terms of effect on land and various things,
p487
aVis almost in a class of its own.
p488
aa(lp489
VCA: If this doesn't work, then what?
p490
aVDo we have to start taking emergency measures
p491
aVto try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?
p492
aa(lp493
VBG: If you get into that situation,
p494
aVit's like if you've been overeating, and you're about to have a heart attack.
p495
aVThen where do you go?
p496
aVYou may need heart surgery or something.
p497
aVThere is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,
p498
aVwhich are various techniques that would delay the heating
p499
aVto buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.
p500
aVNow, that's just an insurance policy; you hope you don't need to do that.
p501
aVSome people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy
p502
aVbecause it might make you lazy,
p503
aVthat you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.
p504
aVI'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,
p505
aVbut there's now the geoengineering discussion
p506
aVabout: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,
p507
aVor this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?
p508
aa(lp509
VCA: Climate skeptics:
p510
aVIf you had a sentence or two to say to them,
p511
aVhow might you persuade them that they're wrong?
p512
aa(lp513
VBG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.
p514
aVThe ones who make scientific arguments are very few.
p515
aVAre they saying there's negative feedback effects
p516
aVthat have to do with clouds that offset things?
p517
aVThere are very, very few things that they can even say
p518
aVthere's a chance in a million of those things.
p519
aVThe main problem we have here \u2014 it's kind of like with AIDS:
p520
aVyou make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.
p521
aa(lp522
VAnd so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,
p523
aVthe idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,
p524
aVand a somewhat uncertain pain thing.
p525
aVIn fact, the IPCC report \u2014 that's not necessarily the worst case,
p526
aVand there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say,
p527
aV"OK, that isn't that big of a deal."
p528
aVThe fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.
p529
aVBut my dream here is that,
p530
aVif you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints,
p531
aVthen the skeptics say,
p532
aV"OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,
p533
aVI kind of wish it did put out CO2.
p534
aVBut I guess I'll accept it,
p535
aVbecause it's cheaper than what's come before."
p536
aa(lp537
V(Applause)
p538
aa(lp539
VCA: So that would be your response to the Bjørn Lomborg argument,
p540
aVbasically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,
p541
aVit's going to take away all your other goals
p542
aVof trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,
p543
aVit's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources
p544
aVto put money towards that
p545
aVwhen there are better things we can do.
p546
aa(lp547
VBG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece \u2014
p548
aVsay the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now \u2014
p549
aVit's not that dramatic.
p550
aVIt shouldn't take away from other things.
p551
aVThe thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree,
p552
aVis when you have something that's non-economic
p553
aVand you're trying to fund that \u2014
p554
aVthat, to me, mostly is a waste.
p555
aVUnless you're very close,
p556
aVand you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap,
p557
aVI believe we should try more things
p558
aVthat have a potential to be far less expensive.
p559
aVIf the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"
p560
aVthen the rich can afford that.
p561
aVI mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy
p562
aVand not change our lifestyle.
p563
aVThe disaster is for that two billion.
p564
aa(lp565
VAnd even Lomborg has changed.
p566
aVHis shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?"
p567
aVHe's still, because of his earlier stuff,
p568
aVstill associated with the skeptic camp,
p569
aVbut he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,
p570
aVand so, he's making the R&D point.
p571
aVAnd so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.
p572
aVThe R&D piece \u2014 it's crazy how little it's funded.
p573
aa(lp574
VCA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here
p575
aVto say I really hope your wish comes true.
p576
aVThank you so much.
p577
aa(lp578
VBG: Thank you.

A geek icon, tech visionary and business trailblazer, Gates&#39; leadership -- fueled by his long-held dream that <strong>millions might realize their potential through great software</strong> -- made Microsoft a personal computing powerhouse and a trendsetter in the Internet dawn. Whether you&#39;re a suit, chef, quant, artist, media maven, nurse or gamer, you&#39;ve probably used a Microsoft product today.<br /><br />In summer of 2008, Gates left his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus on philanthropy. Holding that <strong>all lives have equal value (no matter where they&#39;re being lived)</strong>, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now donated staggering sums to HIV/AIDS programs, libraries, agriculture research and disaster relief -- and offered vital guidance and creative funding to programs in global health and education.

the founder and former CEO of Microsoft. A geek icon, tech visionary and business trailblazer, Gates&#39; leadership -- fueled by his long-held dream that <strong>millions might realize their potential through great software</strong> -- made Microsoft a personal computing powerhouse and a trendsetter in the Internet dawn. Whether you&#39;re a suit, chef, quant, artist, media maven, nurse or gamer, you&#39;ve probably used a Microsoft product today.<br /><br />In summer of 2008, Gates left his day-to-day role with Microsoft to focus on philanthropy. Holding that <strong>all lives have equal value (no matter where they&#39;re being lived)</strong>, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has now donated staggering sums to HIV/AIDS programs, libraries, agriculture research and disaster relief -- and offered vital guidance and creative funding to programs in global health and education. Gates believes his tech-centric strategy for giving will prove the killer app of planet Earth&#39;s next big upgrade. </p><p>Read a collection of Bill and Melinda Gates&#39; <a href=\\"http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">annual letters</a>, where they take stock of the Gates Foundation and the world.
