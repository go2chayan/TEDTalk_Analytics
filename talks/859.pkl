VGood afternoon.
p5
aVThere's a medical revolution happening all around us,
p6
aVand it's one that's going to help us conquer
p7
aVsome of society's most dreaded conditions,
p8
aVincluding cancer.
p9
aVThe revolution is called angiogenesis,
p10
aVand it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo why should we care about blood vessels?
p13
aVWell, the human body is literally packed with them \u2014
p14
aV60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.
p15
aVEnd to end, that would form a line that would circle the earth twice.
p16
aVThe smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.
p17
aVWe've got 19 billion of them in our bodies.
p18
aVAnd these are the vessels of life,
p19
aVand as I'll show you, they can also be the vessels of death.
p20
aVNow, the remarkable thing about blood vessels
p21
aVis that they have this ability
p22
aVto adapt to whatever environment they're growing in.
p23
aVFor example, in the liver, they form channels to detoxify the blood;
p24
aVin the lungs, they line air sacs for gas exchange.
p25
aVIn muscle, they corkscrew,
p26
aVso that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation.
p27
aVAnd in nerves, they course along like power lines,
p28
aVkeeping those nerves alive.
p29
aa(lp30
VWe get most of these blood vessels
p31
aVwhen we're actually still in the womb.
p32
aVAnd what that means is that as adults,
p33
aVblood vessels don't normally grow.
p34
aVExcept in a few special circumstances.
p35
aVIn women, blood vessels grow every month,
p36
aVto build the lining of the uterus.
p37
aVDuring pregnancy, they form the placenta,
p38
aVwhich connects mom and baby.
p39
aVAnd after injury, blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab
p40
aVin order to heal a wound.
p41
aVAnd this is actually what it looks like,
p42
aVhundreds of blood vessels, all growing toward the center of the wound.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo the body has the ability to regulate
p45
aVthe amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.
p46
aVIt does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances,
p47
aVstimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis,
p48
aVsuch that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels,
p49
aVthe body can do this by releasing stimulators,
p50
aVproteins called angiogenic factors,
p51
aVthat act as natural fertilizer, and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.
p52
aVWhen those excess vessels are no longer needed,
p53
aVthe body prunes them back to baseline,
p54
aVusing naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
p55
aVThere are other situations where we start beneath the baseline,
p56
aVand we need to grow more blood vessels, just to get back to normal levels \u2014
p57
aVfor example, after an injury \u2014
p58
aVand the body can do that too, but only to that normal level,
p59
aVthat set point.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut what we now know, is that for a number of diseases,
p62
aVthere are defects in the system,
p63
aVwhere the body can't prune back extra blood vessels,
p64
aVor can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time.
p65
aVAnd in these situations, angiogenesis is out of balance.
p66
aVAnd when angiogenesis is out of balance,
p67
aVa myriad of diseases result.
p68
aVFor example, insufficient angiogenesis \u2014 not enough blood vessels \u2014
p69
aVleads to wounds that don't heal, heart attacks,
p70
aVlegs without circulation, death from stroke,
p71
aVnerve damage.
p72
aVAnd on the other end, excessive angiogenesis \u2014
p73
aVtoo many blood vessels \u2014 drives disease,
p74
aVand we see this in cancer, blindness,
p75
aVarthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.
p76
aVIn total, there are more than 70 major diseases
p77
aVaffecting more than a billion people worldwide,
p78
aVthat all look on the surface to be different from one another,
p79
aVbut all actually share abnormal angiogenesis
p80
aVas their common denominator.
p81
aVAnd this realization is allowing us to re-conceptualize
p82
aVthe way that we actually approach these diseases,
p83
aVby controlling angiogenesis.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, I'm going to focus on cancer,
p86
aVbecause angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer \u2014
p87
aVevery type of cancer.
p88
aVSo here we go.
p89
aVThis is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous mass growing inside a brain.
p90
aVAnd under the microscope,
p91
aVyou can see hundreds of these brown-stained blood vessels,
p92
aVcapillaries that are feeding cancer cells,
p93
aVbringing oxygen and nutrients.
p94
aVBut cancers don't start out like this,
p95
aVand in fact, cancers don't start out with a blood supply.
p96
aVThey start out as small, microscopic nests of cells,
p97
aVthat can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size.
p98
aVThat's the tip of a ballpoint pen.
p99
aVThen they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply,
p100
aVso they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients.
p101
aa(lp102
VIn fact, we're probably forming these microscopic cancers
p103
aVall the time in our body.
p104
aVAutopsy studies from people who died in car accidents
p105
aVhave shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50
p106
aVactually have microscopic cancers in their breasts.
p107
aVAbout 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s
p108
aVhave microscopic prostate cancers,
p109
aVand virtually 100 percent of us, by the time we reach our 70s,
p110
aVwill have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.
p111
aVYet, without a blood supply,
p112
aVmost of these cancers will never become dangerous.
p113
aVDr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor
p114
aVand who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field,
p115
aVonce called this "cancer without disease."
p116
aa(lp117
VSo the body's ability to balance angiogenesis,
p118
aVwhen it's working properly,
p119
aVprevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.
p120
aVAnd this turns out to be
p121
aVone of our most important defense mechanisms
p122
aVagainst cancer.
p123
aVIn fact, if you actually block angiogenesis
p124
aVand prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells,
p125
aVtumors simply can't grow up.
p126
aVBut once angiogenesis occurs,
p127
aVcancers can grow exponentially.
p128
aVAnd this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless,
p129
aVto being deadly.
p130
aVCancer cells mutate,
p131
aVand they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors,
p132
aVnatural fertilizer,
p133
aVthat tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer.
p134
aVAnd once those vessels invade the cancer,
p135
aVit can expand, it can invade local tissues,
p136
aVand the same vessels that are feeding tumors
p137
aVallow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases.
p138
aVAnd unfortunately, this late stage of cancer
p139
aVis the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed,
p140
aVwhen angiogenesis is already turned on,
p141
aVand cancer cells are growing like wild.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo, if angiogenesis is a tipping point
p144
aVbetween a harmless cancer and a harmful one,
p145
aVthen one major part of the angiogenesis revolution
p146
aVis a new approach to treating cancer
p147
aVby cutting off the blood supply.
p148
aVWe call this antiangiogenic therapy,
p149
aVand it's completely different from chemotherapy,
p150
aVbecause it selectively aims
p151
aVat the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.
p152
aVWe can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal, healthy vessels
p153
aVwe see in other places of the body \u2014
p154
aVthey're abnormal, they're very poorly constructed,
p155
aVand because of that, they're highly vulnerable
p156
aVto treatments that target them.
p157
aVIn effect, when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy \u2014
p158
aVhere, an experimental drug for a glioma,
p159
aVwhich is a type of brain tumor \u2014
p160
aVyou can see that there are dramatic changes that occur
p161
aVwhen the tumor is being starved.
p162
aVHere's a woman with a breast cancer,
p163
aVbeing treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin,
p164
aVwhich is FDA approved.
p165
aVAnd you can see that the halo of blood flow
p166
aVdisappears after treatment.
p167
aa(lp168
VWell, I've just shown you two very different types of cancer
p169
aVthat both responded to antiangiogenic therapy.
p170
aVSo a few years ago, I asked myself,
p171
aV"Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers,
p172
aVeven in other species?"
p173
aVSo here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo,
p174
aVwho had a very aggressive tumor
p175
aVcalled a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder.
p176
aVIt invaded into his lungs.
p177
aVHis veterinarian only gave him three months to live.
p178
aVSo we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs
p179
aVthat could be mixed into his dog food,
p180
aVas well as an antiangiogenic cream,
p181
aVthat could be applied on the surface of the tumor.
p182
aVAnd within a few weeks of treatment,
p183
aVwe were able to slow down that cancer's growth,
p184
aVsuch that we were ultimately able to extend Milo\u2019s survival
p185
aVto six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted,
p186
aVall with a very good quality of life.
p187
aVAnd we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.
p188
aVWe have about a 60 percent response rate,
p189
aVand improved survival for these pets
p190
aVthat were about to be euthanized.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples.
p193
aVThis is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida,
p194
aVand she had these lesions in her mouth
p195
aVthat, over the course of three years,
p196
aVdeveloped into invasive squamous cell cancers.
p197
aVSo we created an antiangiogenic paste.
p198
aVWe had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week.
p199
aVAnd over the course of seven months,
p200
aVthe cancers completely disappeared,
p201
aVand the biopsies came back as normal.
p202
aa(lp203
VHere's a cancer growing on the lip
p204
aVof a Quarter Horse named Guinness.
p205
aVIt's a very, very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.
p206
aVIt had already spread to his lymph nodes,
p207
aVso we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip,
p208
aVand the oral cocktail, so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside.
p209
aVAnd over the course of six months,
p210
aVhe experienced a complete remission.
p211
aVAnd here he is six years later,
p212
aVGuinness, with his very happy owner.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VNow obviously, antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers.
p217
aVAnd in fact, the first pioneering treatments
p218
aVfor people as well as dogs,
p219
aVare already becoming available.
p220
aVThere are 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.
p221
aVBut the real question is:
p222
aVHow well do these work in practice?
p223
aVSo here's actually the patient survival data
p224
aVfrom eight different types of cancer.
p225
aVThe bars represent survival time
p226
aVtaken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy,
p227
aVor surgery, or radiation available.
p228
aVBut starting in 2004,
p229
aVwhen antiangiogenic therapies first became available,
p230
aVyou can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival
p231
aVfor people with kidney cancer, multiple myeloma,
p232
aVcolorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
p233
aVThat's impressive.
p234
aVBut for other tumors and cancer types,
p235
aVthe improvements have only been modest.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo I started asking myself,
p238
aV"Why haven't we been able to do better?"
p239
aVAnd the answer, to me, is obvious:
p240
aVwe're treating cancer too late in the game,
p241
aVwhen it's already established,
p242
aVand oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.
p243
aVAnd as a doctor,
p244
aVI know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage,
p245
aVachieving a cure can be difficult, if not impossible.
p246
aVSo I went back to the biology of angiogenesis, and started thinking:
p247
aVCould the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis,
p248
aVbeating cancer at its own game,
p249
aVso the cancers could never become dangerous?
p250
aVThis could help healthy people,
p251
aVas well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice,
p252
aVand want to find a way to keep it from coming back.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer,
p255
aVI went back to look at cancer's causes.
p256
aVAnd what really intrigued me,
p257
aVwas when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent
p258
aVof environmentally-caused cancers.
p259
aVNow the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet,
p260
aVwhat to strip out, take away.
p261
aVBut I actually took a completely opposite approach,
p262
aVand began asking: What could we be adding to our diet
p263
aVthat's naturally antiangiogenic,
p264
aVand that could boost the body's defense system,
p265
aVand beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?
p266
aVIn other words, can we eat to starve cancer?
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VWell, the answer is yes, and I'm going to show you how.
p271
aVAnd our search for this has taken us to the market,
p272
aVthe farm and to the spice cabinet,
p273
aVbecause what we've discovered
p274
aVis that Mother Nature has laced a large number
p275
aVof foods and beverages and herbs
p276
aVwith naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
p277
aa(lp278
VHere's a test system we developed.
p279
aVAt the center is a ring
p280
aVfrom which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion.
p281
aVAnd we can use this system to test dietary factors
p282
aVat concentrations that are obtainable by eating.
p283
aVLet me show you what happens
p284
aVwhen we put in an extract from red grapes.
p285
aVThe active ingredient is resveratrol,
p286
aVit's also found in red wine.
p287
aVThis inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,
p288
aVby 60 percent.
p289
aVHere's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries.
p290
aVIt potently inhibits angiogenesis.
p291
aVAnd extract from soybeans.
p292
aVAnd here is a growing list
p293
aVof antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying.
p294
aVFor each food type,
p295
aVwe believe that there are different potencies
p296
aVwithin different strains and varietals.
p297
aVAnd we want to measure this because,
p298
aVwell, while you're eating a strawberry
p299
aVor drinking tea,
p300
aVwhy not select the one that's most potent
p301
aVfor preventing cancer?
p302
aa(lp303
VSo here are four different teas that we've tested.
p304
aVThey're all common ones: Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,
p305
aVEarl Grey and a special blend that we prepared,
p306
aVand you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency,
p307
aVfrom less potent to more potent.
p308
aVBut what's very cool
p309
aVis when we combine the two less potent teas together,
p310
aVthe combination, the blend, is more potent than either one alone.
p311
aVThis means there's food synergy.
p312
aa(lp313
VHere's some more data from our testing.
p314
aVNow in the lab, we can simulate tumor angiogenesis,
p315
aVrepresented here in a black bar.
p316
aVAnd using this system, we can test the potency of cancer drugs.
p317
aVSo the shorter the bar,
p318
aVthe less angiogenesis \u2014 that's good.
p319
aVAnd here are some common drugs
p320
aVthat have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people.
p321
aVStatins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
p322
aVand a few others \u2014 they inhibit angiogenesis, too.
p323
aVAnd here are the dietary factors
p324
aVgoing head-to-head against these drugs.
p325
aVYou can see they clearly hold their own,
p326
aVand in some cases, they're more potent than the actual drugs.
p327
aVSoy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.
p328
aVI could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients.
p329
aVImagine if we could create the world's first rating system,
p330
aVin which we could score foods
p331
aVaccording to their antiangiogenic, cancer-preventative properties.
p332
aVAnd that's what we're doing right now.
p333
aa(lp334
VNow, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,
p335
aVand so the real question is:
p336
aVWhat is the evidence in people
p337
aVthat eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer?
p338
aVWell, the best example I know
p339
aVis a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years,
p340
aVin which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes
p341
aVtwo to three times a week,
p342
aVhad up to a 50 percent reduction
p343
aVin their risk of developing prostate cancer.
p344
aVNow, we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene,
p345
aVand lycopene is antiangiogenic.
p346
aVBut what's even more interesting from this study,
p347
aVis that in those men who did develop prostate cancer,
p348
aVthose who ate more servings of tomato sauce,
p349
aVactually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer.
p350
aVSo this human study is a prime example
p351
aVof how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels,
p352
aVcan have an impact on cancer.
p353
aVAnd we're now studying the role of a healthy diet \u2014
p354
aVwith Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University \u2014
p355
aVthe role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis
p356
aVthat we can find in the bloodstream.
p357
aa(lp358
VObviously, what I've shared with you has some far-ranging implications,
p359
aVeven beyond cancer research.
p360
aVBecause if we're right, it could impact consumer education,
p361
aVfood services, public health
p362
aVand even the insurance industry.
p363
aVAnd in fact, some insurance companies
p364
aVare already beginning to think along these lines.
p365
aVCheck out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota.
p366
aVFor many people around the world,
p367
aVdietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution,
p368
aVbecause not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments,
p369
aVbut everybody could benefit from a healthy diet
p370
aVbased on local, sustainable, antiangiogenic crops.
p371
aa(lp372
VNow, finally,
p373
aVI've talked to you about food,
p374
aVand I've talked to you about cancer,
p375
aVso there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about,
p376
aVand that's obesity.
p377
aVBecause it turns out that adipose tissue \u2014 fat \u2014
p378
aVis highly angiogenesis-dependent.
p379
aVAnd like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.
p380
aVSo the question is:
p381
aVCan we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply?
p382
aVThe top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse
p383
aVthat eats nonstop until it turns fat,
p384
aVlike this furry tennis ball.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VAnd the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.
p389
aa(lp390
VIf you take the obese mouse
p391
aVand give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
p392
aVStop the treatment, gains the weight back. Restart the treatment, loses the weight.
p393
aVStop the treatment, it gains the weight back.
p394
aVAnd, in fact, you can cycle the weight up and down
p395
aVsimply by inhibiting angiogenesis.
p396
aVSo this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention
p397
aVmay also have an application for obesity.
p398
aVThe truly interesting thing about this
p399
aVis that we can't take these obese mice
p400
aVand make them lose more weight
p401
aVthan what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be.
p402
aVIn other words, we can't create supermodel mice.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Laughter)
p405
aa(lp406
VAnd this speaks to the role of angiogenesis
p407
aVin regulating healthy set points.
p408
aa(lp409
VAlbert Szent-Györgi once said,
p410
aV"Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen,
p411
aVand thinking what no one has thought."
p412
aa(lp413
VI hope I've convinced you
p414
aVthat for diseases like cancer, obesity and other conditions,
p415
aVthere may be a great power
p416
aVin attacking their common denominator: angiogenesis.
p417
aVAnd that's what I think the world needs now.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Applause)
p422
aa(lp423
VJune Cohen: I have a quick question for you.
p424
aa(lp425
VJC: So these drugs aren't exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now.
p426
aVFor anyone out here who has cancer, what would you recommend?
p427
aVDo you recommend pursuing these treatments now, for most cancer patients?
p428
aa(lp429
VWilliam Li: There are antiangiogenic treatments
p430
aVthat are FDA approved,
p431
aVand if you're a cancer patient,
p432
aVor working for one or advocating for one, you should ask about them.
p433
aVAnd there are many clinical trials.
p434
aVThe Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies,
p435
aVand there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline.
p436
aVSo, consider the approved ones,
p437
aVlook for clinical trials,
p438
aVbut then between what the doctor can do for you,
p439
aVwe need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.
p440
aVThis is one of the themes I'm talking about:
p441
aVWe can empower ourselves
p442
aVto do the things that doctors can't do for us,
p443
aVwhich is to use knowledge and take action.
p444
aVAnd if Mother Nature has given us some clues,
p445
aVwe think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat,
p446
aVand what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day.
p447
aa(lp448
VJC: Right. And along those lines,
p449
aVfor people who might have risk factors for cancer,
p450
aVwould you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically,
p451
aVor simply pursuing the right diet,
p452
aVwith lots of tomato sauce?
p453

VWL: Well, you know, there's abundant epidemiological evidence,
p455
aVand I think in the information age,
p456
aVit doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed,
p457
aVthe National Library of Medicine,
p458
aVto look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction
p459
aVbased on diet and based on common medications.
p460
aVAnd that's certainly something that anybody can look into.
